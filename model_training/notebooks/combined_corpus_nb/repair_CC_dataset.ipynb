His decision to field Elliot Daly on the left wing was left-field and after the match Englandâ€™s head coach talked about the centre as a future fullâ€‘back. The Australian crammed another player into his second-row cupboard by giving Charlie Ewels a first cap from the bench, and in Englandâ€™s past three Tests he has fielded six wings with three different open-sides starting the past four. Jones is using the bench to provide different options: Fiji were thrown on to the ropes by Englandâ€™s speed of thought, hand and foot, and knocked out when the heavyweights Nathan Hughes and Ben Teâ€™o were brought on. England are becoming a team for all seasons. 2)  Home side mix it up to highlight versatility  England might have been expected to take on Fiji up front, dominate the set-pieces and command territory, but they took them on at their own game, keeping the ball in hand (they kicked just 19 times) and moving around opponents who like to tackle runners head-on. Fiji contained Billy Vunipola reasonably effectively but were uncomfortable when ball-carriers went past their outside shoulder. Rather than going to ground, England enjoyed continuity, beating defenders with the timing of their passes, seeking space rather than contact. The prop Mako Vunipolawas involved in two tries, first with a sidestep and then with a delayed pass, while his frontâ€‘row colleague Dan Cole rather more prosaically set up one with a clear-out. The Fiji head coach, John McKee, was asked after the game what he felt was the difference about England since the World Cup. He used the words clinical and clarity, adding they now mixed up their game. They make opponents think.    The second-row Charlie Ewels earned his first England cap from the bench.

They have come to appreciate the value of quick possession at the breakdown; Ben Youngs arrives quickly, there are no heavy forwards acting as first receiver to carry the ball a few centimetres, flop to the ground and slowly recycle. Billy Vunipola is used to make ground and George Ford to create width. The stamina of opponents is tested and Jones has succeeded in raising the intensity levels of his players. New Zealand have been some way ahead of the rest for so long partly because of their ability to see off teams who have stayed close to them in a few lung-busting passages of play. England are moving in that direction. 4) Pacific nations hurt by spread of Fijian wings   Related: Malakai Fekitoa ensures All Blacks get their revenge against Ireland   There were nine wings on international duty at the weekend all of whom were Fijian: three at Twickenham, five in Paris where Australia defeated France and one on the New Zealand bench in Dublin. The World Rugby vice-chairman, Agustin Pichot, wants the residential rules on international qualification changed, making it harder for adult players to treat Test rugby like the club game and qualify for a country they may have no link with by living there for three years. Fiji, like Samoa and Tonga, are unable to offer players a means of making a living out of the game in their countries. They move abroad, some at a young age, and many forge international careers in their new homes. It is happening to South Africa too, which may help Pichot because any reform will need the support of some of the major unions: was it good for the game on Saturday that many of Fijiâ€™s best players were wearing overseas jerseys? 5) Month of firsts shows less could offer everyone more  It has been a month of firsts: Ireland recorded their maiden victory over New Zealand, Italy broke their duck against South Africa and Japan were within 15 seconds of avoiding defeat against Wales in Cardiff for the first time. The major southern hemisphere nations have rarely looked more vulnerable and Argentina were muted by their standards against Wales and Scotland. The extended season in the south, with the expansion of Super Rugby and the Rugby Championship, and the extra long-distance travelling this demands, is having an impact. As talks over the global calendar reach a crucial point, the merit of tours at the end of a long season in June and November is being questioned. Player welfare is a concern, as is value for money for spectators who pay high prices for tickets. Less is sometimes more.   \n",
      "41422  Widowed at 34, Jackie Kennedy gave an interview to Life magazine a week after the assassination of her husband. â€œThereâ€™ll be great presidents again,â€ she said, â€œbut thereâ€™ll never be another Camelot again.â€   Related: Jackie review â€“ Natalie Portman astonishes in remarkably intimate portrait   The metaphor of King Arthurâ€™s mythical land features prominently in Jackie, a new film starring Natalie Portman that retells the 1963 shooting and its aftermath from the first ladyâ€™s point of view. Fascination with the Kennedys and their gilded world â€“ their so-called Camelot â€“ never seems to wane, but the movie may take on an added poignancy and nostalgia for Democrats looking through the prism of America under Donald and Melania Trump. The cultural presence of a president is often remembered long after policies are forgotten. Many in New York, Washington and other liberal cities are coming to terms with an imminent sea change. To give one example, Barack and Michelle Obama hosted the multiracial cast of the musical Hamilton at the White House. Last week, Trump condemned them for expressing political concerns to Vice-President-elect Mike Pence. The 35th president, John F Kennedy, and his wife Jackie were champions of the arts, at ease with the world of Broadway shows. The actor Richard Burton is heard reciting lines from Camelot in the new film. The incoming 45th president, by contrast, is seen by critics as a philistine and vulgarian who never reads books and gets riled by his portrayal on Saturday Night Live. â€œThe Kennedys were like movie stars,â€ said Clint Hill, 84, a former Secret Service agent who was in the Dallas motorcade when the president was assassinated. â€œThey were young and attractive. People envied them and wished they had the same lifestyle.â€ Hill, who was assigned to Jackie and has written a memoir, Mrs Kennedy and Me, added: â€œOf all the first ladies weâ€™ve had, Jackie Kennedy stands out. She changed the role. She was elegant and sophisticated. She took an intense interest in the historical furnishings of the White House. She brought in paintings and furniture that represented the past. She brought entertainers that had not been there before.â€ Jackie is directed by a Chilean, Pablo LarraÃ­n, and structured around the Life magazine interview by Theodore H White at Hyannis Port. It has been praised by critics as an artful approach to a conventional subject â€“ â€œlooping and dizzy, sad and intimateâ€, said Vanity Fair â€“ with a cast including Peter Sarsgaard as Robert Kennedy, Greta Gerwig, John Hurt and Richard E Grant. In one scene, Portman, who has been tipped for an Oscar, is shown washing off her husbandâ€™s blood in a shower. Anita McBride, once chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush, said: â€œI looked at the trailer and was struck how young young she was. What a level of responsibility to take on as a young mother who was very cognizant [of] the way the White House was seen on the world stage. She will always be a figure of grace and strength and we canâ€™t forget her elegance.â€ â€˜This country cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poorâ€™    Jacqueline Kennedy sought to make the White House â€˜a showcase of American art and historyâ€™. Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images   The film goes on limited release on 2 December, seven weeks before Obama leaves the White House and Trump is inaugurated. At 43, Kennedy was the youngest person ever elected US president. At 70, Trump is the oldest. The Kennedys were the first president and first lady born in the 20th century, a generational shift likened to the replacement of black and white with colour. Trump had record disapproval ratings during the campaign, lost the popular vote and has triggered protests in major cities.   Related: Jackie trailer: Oscar-tipped Natalie Portman as the former first lady   Whereas the cerebral Kennedy is remembered for his soaring rhetoric, citing the likes of Leonardo da Vinci and Shakespeare and insisting, â€œThis country cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor,â€ Trump is a businessman and reality TV star who recently opined: â€œYou have to be wealthy in order to be great.â€ Jackie announced soon after her husbandâ€™s election her intention to make the White House â€œa showcase of American art and historyâ€. Newspapers adored her glamour, from her silk chiffon inaugural gown to her pillbox hat, making her one of the most photographed women in the 20th century. Melania, a model, shares an interest in fashion.  At Jackieâ€™s behest, the Spanish cellist Pablo Casals performed at the White House, a moment recreated in LarraÃ­nâ€™s film. The first lady persuaded France to let the Mona Lisa be displayed in Washington, the first time the painting had been loaned abroad. She was instrumental in saving numerous historic buildings from the wrecking ball. Judging from their reception so far, the Trumps will have a tougher time with the arts community. Betty Boyd Caroli, author of Americaâ€™s First Ladies, said: â€œJackie said she wanted the White House to be the best of everything and she brought in cultural talent. I donâ€™t know how the Trump administration will handle that. The first lady will be judged on who performs there, especially if it goes badly.â€ Melania faces another uphill battle, Caroli said, though by no fault of her own. â€œJackie had a good sense of American history. Melania was born in communist Yugoslavia and learned English later in life. If you come here as an outsider, youâ€™ll never know the country as well as someone who grew up here. Thatâ€™s a huge disadvantage as far as I can see.â€ Jackieâ€™s stock has risen among historians, Caroli said, with many now rating her impact as second only to Eleanor Roosevelt. â€œThe audiences I speak to are more complimentary now. She made an impression in other countries and was a style icon and intelligent.â€ But for all its glitter, the legend of Camelot has been challenged amid revelations of JFKâ€™s womanising and secretly poor health. His presidency was cut short â€“ his vice-president, Lyndon B Johnson, achieved far more in terms of legislation, notably regarding civil rights and combating poverty. Anthony Giardina, a novelist and playwright who grew up in the suburbs of Boston, not far from the Kennedy dynasty, observed: â€œWhen you look back at the Kennedy administration, as much as they thrilled us, it was the more pedestrian Johnson who got things done. We find itâ€™s often the less glamorous figures, the Hillary Clintons if you will, who actually get things done.â€ â€˜When Mr Trump takes over, youâ€™ll see him fit the mouldâ€™ Kennedy was a relatively inexperienced senator. Trump has no political experience at all. But Hill, who stayed with Jackie for a year before returning to the White House, serving five presidents over 17 years â€“ his most recent book is Five Presidents â€“ said: â€œWhen Mr Trump takes over the Oval Office, youâ€™ll see him fit the mould. When they walk in, they realise the immense responsibility.   Related: Oscars 2017: 11 female performances too good to be overlooked   â€œThe weight of the office begins to bear down considerably. Itâ€™s more intense the people realise. When you compare photos of the presidents when they start and finish in office, you can see theyâ€™ve aged considerably.â€ As for the forthcoming film, Hill has his reservations, challenging its depiction of what time of day the Life interview took place and Jackie asking him what calibre of gun was used by assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, a conversation he maintains never happened.  â€œItâ€™s a mixed thing,â€ he said, speaking from his home near San Francisco. â€œIâ€™m glad they recognise her importance but itâ€™s sad they depict her in a manner thatâ€™s not factual. â€œThey take a great deal of dramatic licence. A lot of things were fabricated. It misleads people. It changes peopleâ€™s view of history and gives them a false impression of what happened.  â€œJackie Kennedy really was one of a kind and it would be impossible for any actress to do her justice.â€   \n",

Then, she said, Bill Cosby asked her a question: â€œDo you like back rubs or belly rubs?â€ The setting was Cosbyâ€™s hotel room one night in the   after the comedian had appeared at Clemson University, the woman said, according to court records. What allegedly came next follows a familiar pattern in the accusations against the iconic entertainer. The woman, an anonymous Jane Doe accuser in a 2005 civil lawsuit against Cosby, said she rubbed Cosbyâ€™s belly. Thatâ€™s when the story goes foggy. The woman said she passed out. Her accusation, which has not previously been reported, adds to the mountain of publicly known allegations leveled against the    as his case on charges of sexually assaulting a woman he was mentoring slogs through a Pennsylvania court. (Cosby and his attorneys have vigorously denied that he sexually assaulted any women.) The newly surfaced accusations come from a woman known in the 2005 civil suit as Jane Doe No. 6, according to sources who declined to be identified because of ongoing legal cases. Her claim, as well as those of another woman, whom sources identified as Jane Doe No. 8, raises the total number of confirmed Cosby accusers catalogued by The Washington Post from 58 to 60.  Dozens of women have held news conferences or given media interviews to outline their accusations against Cosby, but others have chosen to remain anonymous, even as they have provided detailed accounts of their allegations to attorneys in civil suits or investigators. Among those who have not spoken publicly are four of the 12 Jane Doe accusers who were prepared to testify in the civil lawsuit filed in 2005 against Cosby by Andrea Constand, a former Temple University womenâ€™s basketball official. The Post is publishing only the names of those who have spoken publicly about their allegations. The Constand lawsuit ended in a confidential settlement. Cosby has now been criminally charged with sexually assaulting Constand. The allegations of Jane Doe No. 8, a modeling agency booker, also date back to the  . A friend of hers, a male model named Tony Hogue, said in an interview that she was frantic when she called him from Cosbyâ€™s Manhattan home late one night in 1984. The woman, whoâ€™d been to dinner with Cosby and one of the models from her agency that night, pleaded with Hogue to come get them. She said her â€œclothes were messed up,â€ Hogue recalled, and she was â€œvery uncomfortableâ€ because Cosby was kissing and touching her. Hogue said he initially suggested that his friend ask Cosbyâ€™s driver to take her to the apartment where she was staying. Her response unnerved him: â€œShe said she couldnâ€™t even really move. â€ Hogue, who first gave an account of that evening to the Daily Beast, said he banged on Cosbyâ€™s door for a long time. Finally the comedian answered, he said, acting as though nothing was wrong. Hogue left with his friend and the model, a woman named Beth Ferrier, who would later become Jane Doe No. 5. â€œThey were such a mess that there wasnâ€™t a lot of conversation,â€ he said. During a deposition related to the civil lawsuit, Cosby said he did not know Jane Doe No. 6 or Jane Doe No. 8. A Pennsylvania state judge has ruled that Cosby should stand trial in the case but no date has been set. A pretrial conference is slated for early September. The accusers could play a significant role if the case goes to trial because Pennsylvania law allows testimony in sexual assault cases by other women who make similar allegations. Prosecutors have said Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted Constand at his suburban Philadelphia estate.   of the 60 accusations analyzed by The Post involve allegations of drugging. In a sense, the Jane Does have been through a screening process because they were selected by Constandâ€™s legal team as the 2005 civil lawsuit was being prepared. â€œWe were vetted,â€ one Jane Doe said in an interview on the condition of anonymity because of legal sensitivities associated with the ongoing criminal case. â€œWe were chosen. â€    \n",

cord might not be as easy as you think.As Brian X. Chen writes, people now have plenty of streaming services and devices to choose from if they want to cancel their cable-television subscription. But thatâ€™s precisely the problem: too many options.So Brian teamed up with The Wirecutter, a product recommendation website that The New York Times has collaborated with in the past, to come up with a comprehensive guide for cord-cutting in 2016. The Wirecutter tested various services and hardware to help you figure out what might work for you and what wouldnâ€™t.The resulting guide is tailored to viewersâ€™ personal habits.

But in the end, one woman made the biggest difference. Canada's coach, Melody Davidson, had to choose between the young phenom Shannon Szabados and the veteran Olympian Kim St. Pierre as the starting goalie. She went with youth, and it turned out she made the right choice. Szabados was brilliant, stopping all 28 American shots and enabling Marie-Philip Poulin's two first-period goals to stand up and make Canada the Olympic champion. The 2-0 victory gave Canada its third straight Olympic gold medal. It also came after two consecutive losses to the Americans in major tournament finals, at the world championships in 2008 and 2009. 'At this level you see how deep the goaltending talent is,' U.S. defender Kerry Weiland said. 'You get a hot goaltender and it's hard to put it away.' Canada and the United States are so experienced and so skilled that they are, in the words of Rene Fasel, president of the International Ice Hockey Federation, on a 'different planet' compared with other women's teams. Both teams cruised through their preliminary games, racking up shutouts and double-digit victories. The teams' shooters got plenty of practice, but the goalies sometimes stood around for minutes on end, waiting for someone just to fire a puck at them. Even Sweden, which stunned the United States with a semifinal upset at the 2006 Turin Games, did not put up much of a fight here, losing by 9-1 in the semifinals to the Americans. But the final was a display of top-notch women's hockey, played before a loud sellout crowd at Canada Hockey Place that included Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The American goalie, Jessie Vetter, contributed some fine play of her own, denying Cherie Piper as she cut across the slot in the second period and stopping Haley Irwin on a third-period breakaway. She kept the United States in the game, finishing with 26 saves. But the Americans had trouble generating an attack against the Canadian checking. Bigger and stronger, the Canadian women kept riding them off the puck, and when they did get through, Szabados was there, time and again. She did a split while stopping a shot by Monique Lamoureux with a glove save. Later she gloved a shot with Jenny Potter standing right in front, pushing back when Potter fell on top of her. Twice in the third period she denied Lamoureux again, once with a glove save and again by closing her pads on a sharp deflection from 4 feet away. Poulin gave Canada a 1-0 lead at 13 minutes 55 seconds of the opening period when she one-timed a pass from Jennifer Botterill over Vetter's glove. A few minutes later, the teams were playing four skaters a side when the puck came loose off a draw to the left of Vetter, and Poulin was there again. Her quick wrist shot made the score 2-0 at 16:50. The Americans failed to take advantage of two two-player advantages, one in the first, the other in the second. In the third, they began pressing and pinching but still failed to generate much of an attack and kept getting caught with only one defender back. They were not able to pull Vetter with enough time to make any difference. 'We kept shooting the puck to the glove side,' the American defender Angela Ruggiero said. 'We should have thrown it low and hoped for rebounds.' Fighting back tears, she added: 'What hurts the most is how close this team is. It's such a unique team to play on. I felt that this was our year. We had such equal heart, passion and love of the game. We never lost that -- we just couldn't put the puck in the net.' During the medal ceremony, players from Finland, which won the bronze with a 3-2 overtime victory over Sweden earlier Thursday, smiled and blew kisses as they accepted their medals. The Americans fought back tears as they received their silver medals. The predominantly Canadian crowd joined the American fans in chanting 'U.S.A.! U.S.A.!' and the players waved back warmly at the salute. The Canadian players beamed happily as they got their gold medals. Poulin, whose goals provided the margin of victory, winked at the camera. 'O Canada' was played as the flags were raised. The Canadian women linked arms and sang along. To their right, the Americans also linked arms, in a show of respect. 'This rivalry will never end,' Szabados said. 'It will just keep going on and on.'    \n",

      "10792    Destabilization Expert Robert Ford Possible Choice for Ambassador to EgyptBrandon Turbeville With the geographic size of Egypt, its geopolitical importance, and both its historic and contemporary influence in the Middle East, the post of Ambassador to Egypt is an immensely important position, particularly now that both sides in the Egyptian turmoil have legitimate reasons to distrust and detest the United States. As Michael Gordon of the New York Times writes, Obviously, putting Egypt on a democratic course is not the intention of the United States, evidenced by the support and assistance provided to Morsi and the fanatical Muslim Brotherhood by the U.S. government all the way until the counter-coup was launched by the Egyptian military in response to popular outrage. Morsis constant rewriting of the Egyptian Constitution,[2] capitulation to the IMF,[3] and flirtation with Muslim fundamentalists and warmongers[4] was anything but democratic rule of law. However, with Egypt still finding itself in a state of transition and with increasing tension[5] produced by fanatical elements of the Muslim Brotherhood (itself a creation of Britain[6]) and Morsi supporters against the majority of the Egyptian people,[7] the possible appointment of Ford as Ambassador to the country is a concerning development. This is because, ever since his appointment to the position of Political Counselor to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and his subsequent appointment as Ambassador to Syria, Ford has been nothing more than a destabilization expert, who has sown division and discord between populations and societies as well as serving to weaken the national governments of wherever he is placed. John Negroponte was the U.S. ambassador to Honduras from 1981 to 1985. In this role, he was instrumental in supporting and overseeing the Nicaraguan Contra killers who, although based in Honduras, engaged in horrific acts of terrorism inside Nicaragua. Ultimately, this operation claimed the lives of approximately 50,000 innocent civilians. This is the origin of the term Salvador Option when speaking of the formation of death squads for political purposes, an option that has become a hallmark of Negroponte and the system which he represents. Negroponte was also responsible for the formation of the Honduran death squads who engaged in a mission of terror against opponents of the US-backed Honduran regime as well as the Sandinistas and civilian populations in Nicaragua. As Peter Roff and James Chapin write in their article Face-off: Bushs Foreign Policy Warriors, In 2005, Negroponte was appointed as ambassador to Iraq. In this role, he again oversaw the formation of death squads who targeted both the civilian populations and the Iraqi insurgency. The goal here was to foment division within the insurgency and turn it into a fragmented front. A divided opposition is obviously much easier to defeat than a united one. This theory has been proven accurate time and time again. Indeed, in 2005, a story was leaked to Newsweek[10] where the Pentagon confirmed that it was considering forming hit squads of Kurdish and Shia fighters to target leaders of the Iraqi insurgency in a strategic shift borrowed from the American struggle against left-wing guerrillas in Central America 20 years ago.[11] The Pentagon did more than consider this option. Not very long after this information was leaked, Iraq began to see the results of its implementation. As Dahr Jamail of Antiwar.com wrote in 2007, Nevertheless, serving in Iraq at the same time that the death squads were beginning to make their bloody mark on the cohesion of the insurgency was Robert Ford who, at the time, had been appointed political counselor to the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Ford remained in this post from 2004-2006 where he worked closely with Negroponte. He was also heavily involved in the organization of the death squads. Ford was instrumental in helping make contacts with these individuals, as well as developing and maintaining relations with them for other purposes such as continued and future terror campaigns. In fact, Ford was once described by Negroponte as one of these very tireless people . . . who didnt mind putting on his flak jacket and helmet and going out of the Green Zone to meet contacts. In short, Ford acted as a foot soldier in death squad formation. Attempting to summarize the death squad plan, Michael Hirsh and John Barry of Newsweek wrote in 2005: Notice that the authors mention Syria as a potential target of destabilization as far back as 2005. With this in mind, Fords action in Syria served the exact same purpose as his presence in Iraq only a few years previous.[14] This time, however, it seems that Ford took on a more central role in the affair. Indeed, many Syrians, if not aware of the more sinister acts of Ford, are at least aware that he has been instrumental in fomenting violent rebellion and negative Western public opinion against the ruling government. This is why Fords convoy was attacked by pro-government Syrians[15] as he rode through town meeting with his terrorist pets[16] early on in the Syrian destabilization operation. Fords very presence in Syria was clearly a destabilization tactic.[17] Indeed, he drew quite a bit of international attention to himself by traveling across the country at will, meeting with protestors and turning terrorists into martyrs in the minds of the gullible Western public. Of course, by meeting with protestors one can read instigating terrorism. The mainstream media, however, reports Fords terror encouragement tour as a heroic act of solidarity with the people. Eventually, after a succession of terror tours the Assad regime finally slapped restrictions on Fords travel, requiring him not to leave the boundaries of Damascus. However, Ford openly disregarded those limitations and brazenly began traveling all over Syria, meeting with his terrorist brethren.[18] This visit took place Wednesday, May 9, 2013 and was likely initiated via the Bab al-Salama crossing on the Turkey/Syria border. According to Deborah Thomas of NPR, Although no mention is made of the actual lethal aid that has been provided to the death squads by the generosity of the American taxpayer via Gulf State feudal monarchies such as Saudi Arabia,[20] Thomas points out that the MREs were part of an additional $10 million aid package dedicated to the death squads by the U.S. government. Likewise, Secretary of State John Kerry announced in April that the United States would be donating $123 million to the Syrian death squads, despite facing a worldwide economic depression, drastic levels of unemployment at home, and a manufactured crisis such as the sequester and a host of other domestic crises. Later, in July, the effectively Secret Congress authorized the open shipment of arms to the death squads.[21] Fords visit to Syria[22] is both part of the overarching attempt to further destabilize the country, organize death squad activity, and create a public relations campaign aimed at forming an image of Idriss as a figure around which popular support can be rallied. This, of course, is at least the third time Western interests have attempted to create a freedom fighter lead image for the Syrian death squads Moaz al-Khatib[23] and Ghassan Hitto[24] being the more recent failures. Idriss, although being heavily supported by the West, is now flailing[25] amongst an increasing trend indivision amongst the ranks of the death squads.[26] As Webster Tarpley commented on PressTV on May 10, 2013, Of course, this was not the first time that Ford engaged in a publicity-based visit to the Syrian death squads inside Syria, thus drawing the ire of the Syrian government.[28] In 2011, after his travel as U.S. Ambassador had been restricted due to the destabilization efforts already taking place, Ford traveled to Hama in order to promote and encourage the violent assault waged by the Western-backed death squads against innocent Syrian civilians as well as Syrian soldiers. At the very least, Fords history should be enough to cause some level of concern from both the Egyptian government and from any Westerner of good will. Ford, in virtually all of his appointments has done nothing but serve as a destabilization agent and a hands-on architect of death and destruction. For this reason and for those listed discussed in this article, the Egyptians would be wise to reject Robert Ford as Ambassador to their country, even if the United States Senate does not.

Rappoport February 3, 2016. Vocativ.com has the story, Pregnant Zika victims will be given access to abortions at sea: Now Women on Waves, an organization which uses ships to offer safe abortion services outside the territorial waters of countries where the procedure is restricted or forbidden, has announced that they will begin serving areas affected by Zika. Women on Waves is aiming to give them [pregnant women] a safe, legal alternative. They will provide medical abortions to pregnant women who have Zika in Colombia, Bolivia, Chile, Guadeloupe, Paraguay, Venezuela, Argentina, Surinam, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Panama, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Eligible women must be less than 9 weeks pregnant and are required to fill out an online application to receive the abortifacient drugs. The group has said getting a shipment of the medicine to patients can take between one and five weeks, meaning it will require a woman who discovers shes pregnant to act very quickly to receive help in time. As Ive detailed in previous articles, the original propaganda which launched the whole Zika-birth defect hysteria, has been contradicted by Brazilian researchers whove gone back and rechecked the findings. Theyve found far, far fewer cases of the birth defect, microcephaly, and only a handful of cases where the Zika virus was present. But this hasnt stopped the fear mongers. And now we have abortions at sea, based on zero truth and zero science. Put this together with the travel warnings governments have been issuing to women, and the advisories (dont get pregnant for two years), and this is turning out to be a war against women. Depopulation by press conference. Who will be held responsible? No one. Unless people begin to speak out and ignore the roar of the press and the lying public health agencies. The abortions will continue. Pregnant women will never know the truth, that the loss of their children was created by propaganda. Margaret Chan, the director of the World Health Organization, has admitted that the causal connection between microcephaly (the birth defect) and the Zika virus has not been demonstrated. It is strongly suspected. However, in order to respond quickly to the crisis, the world must act on a suspicion. Someone should point out to her that abortions at sea are now a consequence of what her advisors have told her to suspect. (To read about Jons mega-collection, Power Outside The Matrix, click here.)

                                                                                                                   In a sudden, unscheduled announcement Tuesday, officials from the Centers for Disease Control revealed that they were giving away free ice cream, had enough of the frozen dessert for everyone, and that, by the way, there had also been an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in the United States. CDC chief Thomas Frieden tells citizens not to panic and that they can have as many toppings as they want. CDC director Thomas R. Frieden led the emergency press conference, during which he called for all Americans to step right up and get as much of the tasty ice cream as they wanted, and, in unrelated news, 162 Ebola-related deaths have been reported in 12 states. 'Strawberry, chocolate, butter pecanso many delicious flavors,' said Frieden, who added that this just had to be the greatest day ever, and how could anyone have a care in the world, what with all this free ice cream up for grabs. 'We also have sundaes and sorbets and, look at us, we're all having such a wonderful time!' Continued Frieden, clearing his throat, 'The Ebola virus attacks white blood cells indiscriminately, eventually leading to systemic organ failure as the infected individual literally dissolves from the inside out. There is a 10 percent chance of survival.' Bringing a large spoon of rocky road to his lips, Frieden went on to explain that the CDC was still not sure how the lethal hemorrhagic fever had originated, why it was spreading and mutating at such an alarming rate, or whether the agency was even remotely prepared to deal with the deadly pandemic expected to overtake the country within 72 hours. Stricken with vomiting, diarrhea, and inflamed larynxes, Ebola victims hemmorhage violently and wait to claim their free cones. The only thing he knew for sure, Frieden told reporters, was that ice cream was always creamy and delicious, so let's not even worry about all that other stuff, and just dig in already. 'I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream!' shouted CDC spokesperson Martha Hare, who joined Frieden up on stage and began frantically handing out cartons of the sweet summertime dessert to all in attendance. 'Those shrieks, they are definitely for ice cream. Those shrieks, they are not in any way the result of sudden ocular hemorrhaging. Yes, everyone is having a delightful time screaming their heads off about ice cream.' 'Look!' Hare continued. 'Look at all these crunchy waffle cones!' According to officials, federal response teams are currently setting up triage units all across the country and urging every citizen to 'go ahead and put some chocolate sauce right on top of that ice cream now, because within 21 days, none of this is going to matter anyway.' In addition, the agency explained that unless something is done to stop the latest strain of the virus, which appears to be transmittable through skin contact and airborne agents, close to 96 percent of the population could be wiped out, 'so, great newsmore tasty ice cream for the rest of us!' 'This will easily be the most lethal epidemic in U.S. history,' said Dr. Howard Copeland, a triage-unit surgeon who was called in by the government to deal with 'all the fun everyone is having.' 'Fever, vomiting, massive body rashes, blood pouring out from the ears. These are all symptoms of Ebola.' Added the man whom the CDC has dubbed Dr. Happy Party Time, 'Now, um, who wants some sprinkles on their sundae?' Records indicate this isn't the first time the agency has offered the American public a special treat. In March 1982, the CDC delivered news of a virulent new strain of influenza while simultaneously setting off a series of jaw- dropping fireworks. And in 2003, agency director Julie Gerberding informed the public of a possible anthrax outbreak while wearing an oversized sombrero and throwing free tokens into the air at a local Chuck E. Cheese's. Though epidemiologists have predicted the Ebola virus will utterly devastate the populace, the economy, and the entire civilization of the United States, most are taking the terrifying news in stride. 'Oh, man, this is so, so good,' said Seattle resident Michael Sturges, his eyes rolling back in his head as his inflamed orifices excreted a relentless flow of liquefied waste. 'Cookies and cream! Mmm-hmm. It's the best.' \n",

House Admits America Is Officially an EmpireBy Aaron and Melissa Dykes Just kidding, they did this on purpose and werent even trying to be subtle about it. Welcome to the Dark Side. Cue the Imperial March. Earnest: On behalf of the American government, wed like to thank our corporate sponsor Disney Aaron Dykes and Melissa Melton Dykes created TruthstreamMedia.com as an outlet to examine the news, uncover the deceptions, pierce through the fabric of illusions, know the real enemy, unshackle from the system, and begin to imagine the path towards taking back our lives, one step at a time, so that one day we might truly be free The dark side we dont want. But I had a thought. If DC was wiped out, we would no longer have a dark side.!!! Maybe then we could get this country back to the founding fathers dream. Has does that sound DC and the WH.!!!!! Exactly right. Then take down Wall Street, and remove all the uber-wealthy elite from their various seats of power. \n",

Its a veritable goldmine for governments as well. Everything that people used to keep to themselves in previous generations, is now willingly shouted into the Internet abyss for all to hear. Social media users often feel free to share their most controversial, subversive, and inflammatory thoughts on a platform that could reach millions of people. Its kind of crazy when you think about it, but its the world we live in today. Governments of course, love this. People say things on the Internet, that in years past would require a warrant to discover. Law enforcement would have to get permission from a judge to tap someones phone, or search their house for diaries and letters that would give them a damning insight into that persons psychology and intentions. Now we just give it away for free. Obviously, this makes it very easy for the government to identify individual threats. Somebody can talk about overthrowing the government on social media, and either theyll be reported or some NSA algorithm will pick them up, and add their comments to a threat matrix. But social media has the potential to give the government so much more. It can also give them an insight into the collective desires of the masses. A new study was recently conducted by Arizona State University, Texas AM, and Yahoo, which discovered that with the right algorithm, you can predict with 70% accuracy, the probability that any given Twitter user is going post something that is part of a protest. They could use this information to predict a protest movement in the real world, as well as how big it will eventually become. The researchers collected 2,686 posts related to the Nigerian general election that took place between February and April of last year, an election that was marred by political violence in the form of the Boko Haram insurgency and that was beset by accusations of voting irregularities. So what predicts when someone begins protesting on Twitter? Its not your personal history so much as your Twitter history of interacting with people who are part of thatmovement. The interaction we study is how users mention each other, researchers Suhas Ranganath and Fred Morstatter wrote to Defense One in an email. In the model, the probability of the future post expressing protest increases if: 1) The post mentioning the user is related to the protest. 2) The author of the post mentioning the user is interested in the protest. We dynamically learn [or teach] the model by testing how each of the previous status messages of the given user are affected by the recent posts mentioning him. We then use the model to predict the likelihood of the user expressing protest in his nextpost. Their accuracy threshold of 70 percent is because what might seem completely unpredictable is in fact part of a pattern, albeit one thats incredibly complex. The researchers employed Brownian motion theory to design the formula, a theory that usually is employed to track the movement of particles, as well as model stock market fluctuations and other highly complicated systems. Brownian Motion for fluid particles models change in the direction of the particle movement on collision with other particles. We take each particle as a social media user. We relate collision with other particles, other users mentioning him, and the change in direction to change of the users inclination to express protest in his next post. We then use the models of Brownian motion to relate the two quantities. We mainly employ this to model the dynamic change in user behavior resulting from interactions over time, Suhas told DefenseOne. I might add that it wasnt just some university or a private company that decided to fund this study. The Office of Naval Research chipped in as well, so clearly the government is interested in this sort of thing. For them, social media is a powerful tool. The deeply personal opinions that you might shout into the Internet, gives the government the power of prognostication. And as computer technology advances, they will be able to do better than 70%. Theyll be able to look at the information you post on social media, compare that to what everyone else is saying, and theyll be able to predict wars, protests, and revolutions long before they occur. And thats an incredibly dangerous power for any government to have. Joshua Krause is a reporter, writer and researcher at The Daily Sheeple.

It isnt just twitter users- its ALL computer users and smart phone users too. All of your data is being sucked up and placed in places like Bluffdale, UT (NSA Utah Data Center) to be data mined against your interests.Needless to say, you are paying for it all. the Utah Data Center is costing $2 Billion and it is one of many. Computers keep records, its what they do. I dont think there is any kind of delete button that actually deletes on-line info. PERSONAL STORY Back in the 1990s I took a picture of my then 7-year old son holding an AK-47 at my friends gun shop (I worked there) My son use that picture for his avatar in his teen years. But he deleted it from all accounts when he started looking for a job, that was 10-years ago. He tells me that it still turns up occasionally. Where is it being stored? Who knows, but its on the net someplace and it seems forever tied to him. Little did we know Moral of the story, on-line info, action, pictures and comments are there for ever so watch what you do! Just my thoughts but..computers are programmed to find patterns follow logical outcomesso remember on several sci-fi shows ( Star Trek comes to mind as one) that ILLOGICAL actions statements caused the computer to break down ? Star Trek was good entertainment, not reality. When you enter wrong information a computer ignores it, asks for more information or probably 20 other things. But what it doesnt do (like in Star Trek) is to burn up with smoke. Computers today are data recording machines that keep data FOREVER and look for patterns. Ever look at something on Amazon or U-Tube? Notice how it shows patterns of what you looked at previously? Now imagine the NSA looking at your patterns. This is what we face, not a computer that will burn up if you try to stump it with false data. In fact putting in false data may set off alarms. YES, I did not imply the computer would burn up. I am questioning whether incorrect or opposite data would cause the algorithm to take a side track come to different conclusions eventually MORPH the ACTUAL results had the original data been 100 % correct. The idea of this is NOT for your or our benefit but to MESS UP the algorithm so it eventually stores feeds itself on JUNK data causing incorrect conclusions. \n",
