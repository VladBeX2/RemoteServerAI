      "the same conundrum any country faces when traumatized by terrorist acts. “If there is no security,\n",
      "there would be no room to enjoy the liberties,” he said. “This situation leads to prioritizing\n",
      "security while answering questions, ‘security or liberty?’ This is not only valid for Turkey but for\n",
      "all other liberal democracies. ” Turkish liberals say they understand the need for extraordinary\n",
      "measures, but they make two counter arguments. One is that Turkey’s broad crackdown  —   in putting\n",
      "so many journalists and intellectuals in jail  —   has gone too far, and is seemingly unrelated to\n",
      "fighting terrorism. Another is that, even with emergency rule, the country has become less safe. “On\n",
      "the contrary, we have faced more attacks, more terror,” said Yaman Akdeniz, a lawyer and professor\n",
      "at Bilgi University in Istanbul who represents many jailed journalists. He continued, “there is\n",
      "emergency rule in France, but there is no other country limiting fundamental rights and freedoms on\n",
      "this scale. ” Orhan Kemal Cengiz, a prominent human rights lawyer who was briefly detained after the\n",
      "attempted coup, put it this way: “Yes, ISIS is attacking. The P. K. K. is attacking. There was this\n",
      "coup d’état attempt. But what is this to do with all these journalists? There are over 150\n",
      "journalists in jail. And with every passing day, they arrest more and more people. ” Marc Pierini, a\n",
      "visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in Brussels who was a former European Union ambassador to\n",
      "Turkey, said the   purges in the military, the courts and the police have, paradoxically,\n",
      "compromised the country’s ability to protect the public. Mr. Pierini also took issue with the\n",
      "government’s contention that its response to threats has been appropriate. “As we’ve seen after the\n",
      "coup, the reaction is way outside of the formal rule of law. You started arresting police and\n",
      "gendarmes, now writers, actors, journalists  —   so there is no limit,” he said. “When you start\n",
      "pulling the thread on the rule of law, the whole sweater can come off. And that’s where we stand. ”\n",
