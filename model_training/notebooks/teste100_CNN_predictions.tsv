"President Donald Trump repeatedly clashed with ABC News’ Terry Moran about whether Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia — whom the U.S. government deported to El Salvador in March despite an order not to deport him there — had MS13, representing the MS-13 gang, tattooed on his knuckles.During the ABC News interview that aired April 29, Trump referred to an image he shared on Truth Social on April 18 showing what he said was Abrego Garcia’s tattoos. The image shows a left hand with four tattoos, one on each finger — a marijuana leaf, a smiley face with the letter X for eyes, a cross and a skull.The hand also displays an M, an S, a 1 and a 3 in a printed font above these tattoos. The words describing the pictorial tattoos also appear below each one in a small, printed typeface. Trump told Moran that Abrego Garcia’s hand says MS13, which Moran said was disputed and that some had said the tattoos were ""interpreted that way."" Trump said, ""Don't do that — M, S, one, three — it says M, S, one, three."" Moran countered, ""That was Photoshopped."""	1	REAL	0.7465933

"Gov. Ron DeSantis is striving to make the U.S. like Florida, but there’s one costly way Americans may not want to mimic the Sunshine State: the cost of homeowners insurance.Former President Donald Trump, the early front-runner in the Republican presidential primary fight, suggested DeSantis should spend less time campaigning and more time lowering homeowners’ insurance bills.""We want him to get home and take care of insurance, because you have the highest insurance in the nation,"" Trump said at the Turning Point Action conference, a Republican gathering in West Palm Beach.Trump was referring to homeowners insurance. Days earlier, Farmers Insurance said  it will no longer offer insurance plans in Florida.The Trump campaign pointed to news articles showing that Florida has rising homeowners insurance costs and far above the national average.Trump is correct that Florida has the nation’s costliest highest homeowners insurance. The market has been fraught for decades. DeSantis ""inherited already high homeowners insurance, and he inherited a market that has been fragile since Hurricane Andrew"" in 1992, said Charles Nyce, a risk management and insurance professor at Florida State University. (Nyce was part of a group of Florida State professors that was hired by Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state insurer, to write a 2020 report about strategies to halt Citizens’ growth.)DeSantis has signed multiple bills that could lead to lower premiums in the future.

"President Donald Trump said this week that he plans to send federal law enforcement agents into major American cities to combat a surge in violent crime, and Philadelphia is one of his targets.His initial announcement Monday came days after camouflage-clad federal agents swept demonstrators off the streets of Portland, Ore. – a heavy handed response that drew criticism from several Democratic mayors, including Philadelphia’s Jim Kenney. ""Murders this year have spiked 27% in Philadelphia,"" Trump said Wednesday during a speech he delivered from the White House’s East Room. Trump is right. So far this year, there have been 232 homicides in Philadelphia, 50 more than at this time last year, city crime statistics show. That’s an increase of 27 percent. Five people have been murdered across the city since Monday night alone. Violent crimes such as rape, robbery, and some types of aggravated assault have fallen amid the coronavirus pandemic, but homicides and nonfatal shootings have not abated, frustrating city leaders who have called for calm. Other cities like Chicago and Detroit have also been battling a rise in shootings during the pandemic.One day last month, 23 people were shot across Philadelphia — the most in a single day since at least 2013. Six of the victims died, including a 6-year-old boy who police believe was mistakenly shot by a 5-year-old boy inside an Upper Holmesburg rowhouse. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw and District Attorney Larry Krasner have pledged to increase the number of gun violence cases that result in arrest and prosecution. They also say tackling the widespread poverty that underpins much of the city’s violent crime is a critical part of the solution. City resources have been stretched thin because of the ongoing protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Kenny said earlier this month. City Council President Darrell L. Clarke called the source of the rising crime rate a ""perfect storm"" of problems, including widespread poverty, the coronavirus, the ongoing unrest, and easy access to guns — issues he said the City Council was working to improve.""At the end of the day, we’ve got to get through this,"" Clarke said. ""We got to figure out a way.""Kenney said Monday he doesn’t want help from federal law enforcement officers and vowed that if Trump sends them anyway, ""we would use all available means to resist such a wrong-headed effort and abuse of power."" ""To send federal agents to police U.S. cities that have not requested such aid can only impede the work of local governments and exacerbate already heightened tensions in these cities,"" Kenny added.

"President Donald Trump criticized New York Democrats on Twitter, asserting they blocked a bill expanding access to college tuition for military families after they approved aid for ""illegal immigrants.""""In New York State, Democrats blocked a Bill expanding College Tuition for Gold Star families after approving aid for illegal immigrants,"" Trump wrote. ""No wonder so many people are leaving N.Y. Very Sad!""The vote by Democrats in the New York State Legislature to delay or deny expanded college benefits for families of servicemembers, as described in a Republican-sponsored bill, became national news. Five days after Trump’s tweet, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, took executive action to expand financial aid for certain military families, as Republicans had proposed. We decided to investigate this claim from the president.Background The bill in question, A.2991, would expand an existing financial aid program for dependent survivors of military members who died, were severely and permanently disabled, or were classified as missing in action while in combat or preparing for combat. The military enhanced recognition, incentive and tribute scholarship program, or MERIT, already provides tuition and other expenses at approved colleges in New York state for these dependents, or for military members who became severely and permanent disabled themselves during combat or in training for combat.Covered expenses include tuition for four years, or for five years for selected five-year programs, equal to in-state State University of New York tuition, or the student’s actual tuition, whichever is less. Allowances for room and board, transportation, and books are also included. In 2018-19, the benefit is $24,250 for students living on campus, and $15,750 for students who commute to school, according to the Higher Education Services Corporation. Additional eligibility requirements apply, such as being enrolled as a full-time student and being in good academic standing. In 2018, an estimated 111 students received this award, totaling $1.8 million, according to Cuomo."	1	FAKE	0.48262987

""They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires. Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country...Bipartisan Bill!""Trump’s tweets followed some blame and confusion about nearly 1,500 ""lost"" immigrant children. In late April, a federal agency reported being unable to locate about 1,500 children who came to the United States alone. Around the same time, the Trump administration announced a ""zero-tolerance"" policy to ramp up prosecutions of individuals who cross the border illegally.Trump’s tweet is accurate. One of the Democrats who shared the photo was Jon Favreau, a former Obama speechwriter.Favreau, who has one million followers on Twitter, tweeted on May 27: ""Look at these pictures. This is happening right now, and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible.""Favreau included a link to a Arizona Republic story showing a photo of two detainees lying on mats on the ground in a holding cell with the headline ""First Glimpse of Immigrant Children at holding facility."" While Favreau has since deleted the tweet, Twitchy and Fox News showed screen grabs.The photo was taken by Ross D. Franklin of the Associated Press in June 2014 at a Customs and Border Protection Agency center in Nogales, Arizona. The photo was used in an Arizona Republic article which described the migrants as ""children in cages."" The newspaper verified the timing of the photo in a tweet.Minutes after Favreau’s tweet about the photo, at 3:27 p.m. Favreau followed up with a tweet that cited the actual date of the photo.""These awful pictures are from 2014, when the government's challenge was reconnecting unaccompanied minors who showed up at the border with family or a safe sponsor. Today, in 2018, the government is CREATING unaccompanied minors by tearing them away from family at the border.""Favreau responded to our questions by pointing to his May 29 Twitter thread, including this tweet:""I tweeted a story that multiple journalists were posting.

"Donald Trump says China, Singapore have death penalty for drug dealers President Donald Trump floated the idea of imposing the death penalty on drug dealers in the United States during his Pennsylvania rally, saying China and Singapore do it and they don’t have a drug problem.""The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness,"" Trump said March 10 while stumping for Republican congressional candidate Rick Saccone. ""When you catch a drug dealer … you got to put him away for a long time.""Trump shared conversations he had with leaders of China and Singapore.""When I was in China and other places, by the way, I said, Mr. President, do you have a drug problem? ‘No, no, no, we do not.’ I said, Huh. Big country, 1.4 billion people, right. Not much of a drug problem. I said what do you attribute that to? ‘Well, the death penalty.’""On Singapore, ""I said, Mr. President, what happens with your drugs? ‘No. We don't have a problem, President.’ I said, really why? ‘We have a zero tolerance.’ And he is not playing games … So what do you mean no problem? ‘We have a zero tolerance policy.’ What does that mean? ‘That means if we catch a drug dealer, death penalty.’ ""PolitiFact decided to fact-check whether China and Singapore have the death penalty for drug dealers as Trump claimed. (We will set aside for now whether these countries have ""no"" drug problems as a result, as Trump claimed the leaders said.)We found those countries do have the death penalty for individuals who traffic, smuggle or transport certain drugs. The White House did not comment on the record, but in the context of Trump’s speech, it appears these are the individuals he was referring to when speaking about ""drug dealers"" — not just individuals who may sell drugs on the streets.Nonetheless, China and Singapore have also been called out as human rights abusers for these practices, and drug policy and law experts expressed skepticism about the death penalty being a deterrent for drug trafficking in the United States.China’s laws Chinese law says that individuals who smuggle, traffic, transport or manufacture drugs and meet certain conditions are to be punished with 15 years of fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment or death sentence, and confiscation of their properties.The law mentions certain amounts of opium, heroin, methylaniline and ""other narcotic drugs of large quantities.""Human rights groups and experts say data on death sentences and executions in China is unreliable and unknown. That information is kept as a state secret. Amnesty International estimates thousands of people are executed and sentenced to death each year.Given data limitations, it's difficult to assess the efficacy of its policy against drug offenders.Singapore's law Singapore’s Misuse of Drugs Act calls for the death penalty for individuals convicted of trafficking specified amounts of opium, cocaine, cannabis, and other substances. The law said the word ""traffic"" means to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute.Individuals possessing certain amounts of specified drugs are also presumed to have it for the purpose of trafficking, unless proven otherwise. Recent law revisions give courts discretion not to impose the death penalty in certain circumstances.A March 2010 study on executions, deterrence and homicide in Hong Kong and Singapore said there are ""no decent indicators"" available regarding drug use over time in Singapore, and if the data exists, ""they are a government secret.""Singapore’s minister for foreign affairs, Vivian Balakrishnan, at a September 2016 United Nations meeting said his country regarded drug trafficking ""as a most serious crime,"" and that the death penalty kept major drug syndicates away from Singapore."	1	REAL	0.95181346

Brenden Jones, R-Columbus, made the statement April 2 after he was asked about a bill he introduced to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in state and local governments. The bill passed 69-45, April 30 along party lines, with Republicans in favor. But before it did, Minority Leader Robert Reives, D-Chatham, asked Jones in a House committee meeting about the bill’s title, ""Equality in State Agencies/Prohibition on DEI."" Here’s a transcript of their exchange.Reives: ""I see that (bill title) as an implication that right now there is not equality in hiring in state agencies. Was that a problem that was brought to your attention? And if so, by who?""Jones: ""Yes, and by several different people.""Reives: ""Were those people who were saying that they were being forced to hire by quotas, or something of that sort?""Jones: ""Yes, sir.""Reives: ""What statute is … the quota requirement that you're referring to? I haven't seen it, but, you know, I haven't read the law. So there is a quota requirement, you say?""Jones then cited a state law — GS 143-128.2 — which says:""The state shall have a verifiable 10% goal for participation by minority businesses in the total value of work for each State building project, including building projects done by a private entity on a facility to be leased or purchased by the state.""Jones then said he believes the statute meets the definition of a quota, adding that his push to eliminate it ""stemmed from some of the hurricane disaster relief work that's being done and that contractors are being rejected because they cannot meet some of these so called quotas.""PolitiFact North Carolina reached out to Jones by email and telephone asking him to provide evidence that contractors were turned away from disaster relief work because of the state statute in question.

Josh Stein created this year to help manage relief efforts for Hurricane Helene. Stein spokesperson Morgan Hopkins said the office is not aware of any contractors being turned away from helping because of the statute Jones cited.The state Department of Administration said Jones’s claims are inaccurate.The state law in question references a ""goal"" of 10% participation in state contracts by minority-owned businesses, and the state considers that to be purely a goal — not a quota, said department spokesperson Julia Hegele. ""There are no required quotas for including minority-owned businesses on state contracts,"" Hegele said.North Carolina’s population is 70% white and 22% Black or multiracial, and 11% of the population identifies as Hispanic or Latino, according to 2024 U.S. Census estimates.""The statute includes a 10% goal (not a quota) for including Historically Underutilized Businesses as subcontractors on government-related construction projects but failure to meet the goal does not prevent a bidder from winning the contract,"" she said. ""The law requires contractors to demonstrate good faith efforts to include HUBs as subcontractors.

The Pharmaceutical/Drug Companies would say, for years, that it was Research and Development Costs, and that all of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the “suckers” of America, ALONE. Campaign Contributions can do wonders, but not with me, and not with the Republican Party. We are going to do the right thing, something that the Democrats have fought for many years. Therefore, I am pleased to announce that Tomorrow morning, in the White House, at 9:00 A.M., I will be signing one of the most consequential Executive Orders in our Country’s history. Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%. They will rise throughout the World in order to equalize and, for the first time in many years, bring FAIRNESS TO AMERICA! I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION’S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World. Our Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before. Additionally, on top of everything else, the United States will save TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!	0	FAKE	0.112194136

72% of the IUS death reports in the 33 year history of VAERS are from one vaccine: the COVID-19 vaccine. Unlike other vaccines, the COVID vaccines keep on killing people, for months and years after the shot. The statistics I’ve been able to collect estimate that the COVID vaccines kill 1 person per 1,000 doses. These vaccines aren’t close to safe, so we don’t even have to get into a discussion as to whether they are effective. They are clearly unsafe and nobody should be taking them. And we can prove that with one VAERS query which nobody can explain away. Anyone can replicate this themselves.What does this mean? It means that the COVID vaccines are killing people. The onset interval is the interval from the time of vaccination until the first symptoms occurred. Since we are looking at death reports, these will be the time until the first symptoms preceding the death appear or, in many cases, the elapsed time until the death itself. A safe vaccine should have a peak near day 0 just due to coincidence causing false reports in the first few days after the vaccine as people falsely associate the death event with the date of vaccination. The rest of the curve should be flat. This is the case for many of the vaccines. For example, the Rubella vaccine doesn’t have a single death report in the history of VAERS (but does have 800 adverse event reports). The flu vaccine (FLU4) has an onset curve for deaths that looks like this, but keep in mind that the FLU4 vaccine can be given with other vaccines in the same visit, so it’s hard to separate out just the effect of the FLU4 vaccine, but the point is that if vaccines are safe, the death rates reported after the vaccines should be perfectly flat since deaths are random with respect to a vaccination date.	0	FAKE	0.035507426

The renowned Cleveland Clinic has dropped a bone-chilling warning that millions of people who received Covid mRNA “vaccines” are facing sudden death within the next “five years.” According to the Ohio-based academic medical center, large numbers of the Covid-vaccinated “may need a heart transplant” to avoid a sudden cardiac arrest. However, the pro-vaccination nonprofit has yet to issue a red alert to the public about the looming catastrophic death wave. Instead, Cleveland Clinic quietly dropped the bombshell in a recent update on its website. According to Cleveland Clinic, mass mortality is expected to surge due to a ticking time bomb of myocarditis among the Covid-vaccinated. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle or myocardium. This inflammation weakens your heart muscle, making it harder for your heart to pump.  Myocarditis can cause strokes, blood clots, cardiac arrest, and ultimately sudden death. Doctors warn that myocarditis acts as a silent killer as it can often be symptomless, with many sufferers not being diagnosed until it’s too late.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), myocarditis is a known side effect of Covid mRNA injections. As cases of myocarditis have surged since the Covid “vaccines” were rolled out in early 2021, Cleveland Clinic has now updated its website with alarming new information on the disorder. According to the renowned medical center, 50 percent of people who contracted myocarditis will be dead “five years later.” “For some people, myocarditis can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy and they may need a heart transplant,” the webpage explains.As Slay News recently reported, a world-renowned virologist, who served as Bill Gates’s lead vaccine advisor, has warned the public that a “wave” of “unprecedented deaths” is looming for those who received Covid mRNA injections. Former Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation scientist and vaccine expert Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche has blown the whistle to warn of a coming “wave of morbidity” and “mortality” among the Covid-vaccinated. Dr. Bossche has warned that population numbers worldwide will soon experience a “completely unprecedented” plunge. Bossche predicts that “up to 30-40%” of the general public will soon die “in highly vaccinated countries.” The top scientist raised the alarm during an interview with vaccine expert and investigator Steve Kirsch. “In some of the highly vaccinated populations … I would not be surprised that we will be dealing with serious decimation of the population, in some populations, maybe up to 30 or 40 percent,” Bossche warned.	0	FAKE	0.28516427

LET'S TALK ABOUT IVERMECTIN 1 – Ivermectin prevents the damage caused to RNA Vaccines.  2 – Ivermectin blocks the entry of Spike Protein into cells.  So, if the person was vaccinated with COVID, they have hope, they have a way to treat themselves through Ivermectin.  3 – Ivermectin is a treatment after Covid and after vaccination, it is an effective medicine in all phases of Covid 19, even before entering the cell, Ivermectin already destroys the virus in the blood.  It only has beneficial effects and no harmful effects in the treatment of the coronavirus.  4 – Ivermectin has a very powerful anti-inflammatory action against Coronavirus.  5 – Ivermectin has a powerful action for traumatic and orthopedic injuries, it strengthens muscles and has no side effects like corticosteroids.  6 – Ivermectin treats autoimmune ailments such as: rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, fibromyalgia, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, allergic rhinitis.  7 – Ivermectin reduces the frequency of flu and colds.  8 – Ivermectin improves the immunity of cancer patients.  9 – Ivermectin treats Herpes Simplex and Herpes Zoster.  10 – Ivermectin reduces the frequency of sinusitis and diverticulitis.  11 – Ivermectin protects the heart in cardiac overload, in an embolism for example, it prevents cardiac hypoxia because it stimulates the production of basic energy so that the tissue is not destroyed and thus improves cardiac function.  12 – Ivermectin is antiparasitic.  13 – Ivermectin is anti-neoplastic (anti-cancer), it suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells, only killing cancer cells and preserving healthy cells, improving the effectiveness of chemotherapy treatment, as it kills cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy, defeating the resistance to multiple chemotherapeutics that tumors develop, and combined with chemotherapy and/or anti-cancer agents, it provides an increase in the effectiveness of these treatments.  14 – Ivermectin is antimicrobial (bacteria and viruses), and increases immunity.  15 – Ivermectin reaches the Central Nervous System and regenerates the nerves.  16 – Ivermectin regulates glucose and insulin metabolism.  17 – Ivermectin regulates cholesterol metabolism.   18 – Ivermectin reduces liver fat in steatose.  19 – Ivermectin protects the liver exposed to insecticides.  20 – Ivermectin attacks the virus wherever it is, regardless of mutations. 21 – Ivermectin serves for the prevention and treatment of coronavirus, surprisingly.  Unproven efficacy is not of Ivermectin, but of vaccines.  22 – Ivermectin, used as a prophylactic agent, was associated with a significant reduction in infection, hospitalization and mortality rates due to COVID-19. 23 - Ivermectin does not attack the liver, since it is not metabolized in it, and if in the intestine, on the contrary, it protects the liver.	0	FAKE	0.13885085

MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES. The Federal Government has a constitutional duty and a moral responsibility to respect and promote the free speech rights of Americans. Christopher Krebs, the former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), is a significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his Government authority. Krebs’ misconduct involved the censorship of disfavored speech implicating the 2020 election and COVID-19 pandemic. CISA, under Krebs’ leadership, suppressed conservative viewpoints under the guise of combatting supposed disinformation, and recruited and coerced major social media platforms to further its partisan mission. CISA covertly worked to blind the American public to the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden’s laptop. Krebs, through CISA, promoted the censorship of election information, including known risks associated with certain voting practices. Similarly, Krebs, through CISA, falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with voting machines. Krebs skewed the bona fide debate about COVID-19 by attempting to discredit widely shared views that ran contrary to CISA’s favored perspective. Abusive conduct of this sort both violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself. Those who engage in or support such conduct must not have continued access to our Nation’s secrets. Accordingly, I hereby direct the heads of executive department and agencies (agencies) to immediately take steps consistent with existing law to revoke any active security clearance held by Christopher Krebs. I further direct the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and all other relevant agencies to immediately take all action as necessary and consistent with existing law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at entities associated with Krebs, including SentinelOne, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest. I further direct the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with any other agency head, to take all appropriate action to review Krebs’ activities as a Government employee, including his leadership of CISA. This review should identify any instances where Krebs’ conduct appears to have been contrary to suitability standards for Federal employees, involved the unauthorized dissemination of classified information, or contrary to the purposes and policies identified in Executive Order 14149 of January 20, 2025 (Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship). As part of that review, I direct a comprehensive evaluation of all of CISA’s activities over the last 6 years, focusing specifically on any instances where CISA’s conduct appears to have been contrary to the purposes and policies identified in Executive Order 14149. Upon completing these reviews, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall prepare a joint report to be submitted to the President, through the Counsel to the President, with recommendations for appropriate remedial or preventative actions to be taken to fulfill the purposes and policies of Executive Order 14149.	0	REAL	0.5579369

Everytown for Gun Safety released a 2023 report citing 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showing firearms are the No. 1 mechanism of death for people ages 18 to 25. Everytown for Gun Safety spokesperson Katie Wertheimer also pointed to a 2022 article published in the journal Pediatrics that found ""firearms are the leading cause of death in children and youth 0 to 24 years of age in the United States."" PolitiFact queried the CDC’s Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System for data on the most recent injury deaths for ages 18 to 25. In 2023, firearms were the mechanism that accounted for the most deaths in that age group, at 8,086. For ages 24 and 25, drug poisoning was the top cause.CDC data showed accidents, followed by suicide and homicide, were the leading causes of death among people ages 18 to 25. These categories all include firearm-related deaths. Brian Tsai, a CDC spokesperson, told PolitiFact that although the agency does not rank firearm deaths as a leading cause of death because they occur across categories, ""our data does show that firearms are the leading mechanism of injury mortality."" ""Categories for ranking cause of death must be mutually exclusive and it has been CDC's longstanding policy to rank the homicide, suicide and unintentional injury categories,"" Tsai said in an email. ""CDC does not classify firearms as a cause of death, but rather as a mechanism by which death occurs (same is true for motor vehicle accidents)."" The CDC considers unintentional firearm injuries as ""fatal or nonfatal firearm injuries that happen while someone is cleaning or playing with a firearm or other incidents of an accidental firing without evidence of intentional harm."" In 2023, CDC data showed unintentional injuries (14,238) were the leading cause of death among people ages 18 to 25, followed by suicide (5,632) and homicide (5,060). Narrowing down to deaths by firearm, the majority were homicides (4,651), followed by suicides (3,158). Gun-rights advocates question whether the term ""gun violence"" should include suicides. Countries such as Canada and Australia include firearm suicide in that term. Surveys about gun violence use varying language and criteria on including suicides. Daniel Webster, distinguished scholar for the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, told PolitiFact the Moms Demand Action statement is accurate."	1	REAL	0.72436607
"One of many things Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said during his record-breaking, 25-hour-plus Senate floor speech: consumers are losing confidence in the U.S. economy. Booker said April 1, ""The consumer confidence in this country has gone way down. If you ask the question, are you better off than you were 71 days ago, not many Americans would say … that they’re better off. Their costs are higher. Their groceries are higher. They’re soon to see everything from car prices to food go higher."" Measures of consumer confidence have historically carried weight both on private-sector business investment decisions and policymaking by elected officials. On April 2, after Booker’s speech, President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs that could affect future consumer confidence levels. For now, though, the latest data available is from February and March. The two main consumer confidence surveys — the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index — support Booker’s statement. Booker’s office confirmed to PolitiFact that those surveys were what the senator referenced.To some extent, ""way down"" is in the eye of the beholder. But compared to recent presidents at the start of their terms, the drop under Trump is unusually large. ""It's a serious fall,"" said Dean Baker, an economist and cofounder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. The Conference Board, a business research group, has produced its Consumer Confidence Index for decades. It gauges consumers’ feelings about topics such as current and future labor market conditions, current and future business conditions and future income expectations. In November 2024, the month Trump was reelected, the index stood at 111.7. Since then, it has fallen every month, with the March measurement at 92.9, a 17% decline since November. The last time the index was below 92.9 was in the first month of Joe Biden’s presidency, January 2021, when it was 87.1. That was during the coronavirus pandemic, and beginning with February 2021, the metric never fell below 92.9 for the remainder of Biden’s term."	1	REAL	0.72732806
"Milwaukee Public Schools has been making recent headlines as a judge on Feb. 18, 2025, said the school board overseeing MPS and the city of Milwaukee must split the cost of a school police program down the middle and put police in schools with a deadline of Feb. 27, according to a Feb. 19, 2025, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. On deadline day, a judge held the city of Milwaukee in contempt of court for failing to comply with his previous order to have school resource officers in Milwaukee Public Schools by Feb. 27. Milwaukee Circuit Judge David Borowski stayed that order, however, giving the city until March 15 to get the officers in schools or face a $1,000-per-day fine, according to a Feb. 27, 2025, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news report. In the run-up to the earlier court decision, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson discussed his January meeting with GOP legislative leaders at the Capitol during a Jan. 12, 2025, appearance on WISN-12 News ""UpFront"" program. Johnson spoke of his support for getting 25 Milwaukee police officers back into Milwaukee Public Schools. ""Well, you have to have the funding in order to get the officers,"" Johnson said. ""When you go to a restaurant and you order a meal, the chef doesn't prepare your meal and then pick up the check. That's what MPS is asking. I think that's wrong for taxpayers in the City of Milwaukee, especially given the fact that presently, right now, after the referendum, Milwaukee Public Schools has a larger tax levy than the City of Milwaukee.""The deadline is the latest development in a lawsuit seeking to force the MPS school board and city of Milwaukee to comply with a state law known as Act 12. Since Jan. 1, 2024, the law has required the presence of 25 police officers in MPS during school hours, among other things. In April, Milwaukee voters narrowly approved a referendum that will increase property taxes to prevent major budget cuts at Milwaukee Public Schools, according to an April 3, 2024 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. The referendum was crafted to allow MPS to gain an additional $140 million for the next school year, then ramp up to $252 million annually by the 2027-28 school year, according to the Journal Sentinel report. Without the referendum money, MPS projected that it would face a $200 million budget shortfall in the next school year because of rising costs. Those costs include: inflationary raises for staff, filling vacant positions and retaining staff who were funded by sunsetting pandemic-relief aid. The mayor’s claim that Milwaukee Public Schools has a larger tax levy than the City of Milwaukee after the referendum, piqued the interest of PolitiFact Wisconsin, so let’s take a look.

"When the state Legislature kicked off a new session in 2025, one of the first areas of focus for Republicans was education. Bills recently passed by the state Assembly — one step toward reaching the governor’s desk — included reversing changes to test score benchmarks and requiring cursive and civics to be taught in schools. Another bill would require school boards to adopt a policy by July 2026 that prohibits students from using cell phones during instructional time. At a Feb. 19, 2025, press conference before his bill passed the Assembly, state Rep. Joel Kitchens, a Republican from Sturgeon Bay, said ""90% of the (school) districts in Wisconsin already have a policy"" like the one the bill requires.During floor debate on the bill, Democrats argued the bill would take away local control from school boards. Kitchens has pushed back on that idea.""What we really need here is a unified approach,"" Kitchens said at the press conference. ""We are saying to the school districts that we’re standing with you on this, because everyone agrees this is a problem."" The 90% figure caught our attention, especially when there’s so much debate over a policy that might already be par for the course in most school districts. Is it true that the vast majority of Wisconsin school districts already ban cellphones during class time? 90% figure comes from DPI survey of 320 school districts PolitiFact Wisconsin reached out to Kitchens’ office to ask where the 90% number came from. They pointed us to the Department of Public Instruction’s testimony during a Feb. 11 public hearing for the bill. The department referenced its annual Digital Learning Survey. About 320 of the 421 public school districts in Wisconsin participated in the voluntary survey for the 2024-25 school year, officials said. Approximately 90% of districts that took part in the survey ""already have some sort of restrictive cellphone policy in place,"" according to the department. Fewer than 10% of districts did not have a cellphone policy and left it up to teachers to decide how to manage cell phone use in their classrooms, the survey found. While about a quarter of school districts did not participate in the survey, the 75% who did respond still represent the vast majority of districts in Wisconsin.  Cellphone policies ‘vary significantly’ by school district  While the 90% number is solid, it’s quite vague when referring to school districts having ""some sort of restrictive cellphone policy."" The results of the Digital Learning Survey drills down into that 90% number. Of that 90% total, about 26% of districts allow high school students to use cellphones in common areas but not classrooms."	1	REAL	0.79348266
"As the race for control of Wisconsin’s Supreme Court picks up steam, there’s a word you’ve probably heard: Recusal. Recusal refers to a justice’s decision to sit out a case because they have a connection to the lawsuit or lawyers that affects their ability to rule fairly. Dane County Court Judge Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate in the race, was asked by WISN-TV’s ""Upfront"" during its Feb. 9, 2025 episode if she should recuse herself from any case before the Supreme Court involving abortion. Crawford, as a private attorney, represented Planned Parenthood in challenging a state law that required physicians providing abortion services to get admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. ""The law does not require judges to automatically recuse just because they have done some kind of legal work in the past as a lawyer,"" Crawford said.Crawford’s involvement in the case happened about a decade ago: A federal appeals court panel found the law unconstitutional in 2015. Because recusal is bound to come up in the remaining weeks of campaigning, let’s take a look at what the standards are in Wisconsin. Legal experts will also explain why there are often gray areas.Let’s start with laying out what the Code of Judicial Conduct says about recusal, and if it mentions anything about stepping away because of previous work as a lawyer.Here are just a few of the situations where the code says a justice should recuse. The judge was a material witness in the case. The judge, their spouse or minor children have an economic interest in the case. The judge’s spouse or relative is a lawyer in the case. But there’s another one that relates to Crawford’s claim: ""The judge served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy.""Wait — does ""matter in controversy"" mean Crawford would be disqualified from participating in anything related to abortion?That’s not the case, explained Charles Geyh, a professor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law who specializes in judicial ethics. The ""matter"" refers to a specific lawsuit, not a broad issue.  ""You can certainly see where if you expanded it to include the issue, that would get crazy pretty quickly. Lawyers who are active litigators may be addressing bazillions of issue areas,"" Geyh said. Howard Schweber, a professor emeritus of political science and legal studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, noted many judges previously worked as criminal prosecutors or defenders. ""It would be absurd to suggest that those judges must recuse themselves from any case involving a crime,"" Schweber said. "	1	REAL	0.96329993
"Upon returning to the state Capitol in 2025, Wisconsin Republican lawmakers made quick work of approving another statewide referendum question to appear on the ballot for the state’s April election. This one will ask residents whether to amend the state constitution to include an existing law requiring a photo ID to vote. Enshrining it in the constitution would make it harder for the state Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, which Republicans fear because of the court’s current liberal majority. It would also be harder for Democrats to repeal it if they gain control of the Legislature in future years. The GOP maintains that the photo ID law has increased security at the ballot box. But experts and advocates say it’s making it more difficult for certain groups of people to vote, such as Black voters in Milwaukee. In a news release blasting the attempt to get the voter ID law in the constitution, the public advocacy group Common Cause Wisconsin expounded on that. ""Wisconsin makes it more difficult for its citizens to vote than almost any state in the nation,"" the group wrote in the release. When asked to back up the claim, Common Cause Wisconsin Executive Director Jay Heck said he was pulling from the expertise of UW-Madison political science professor Barry Burden, who wrote previously for The Observatory that Wisconsin’s voter ID law is one of the strictest in the country. Burden repeated it in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, writing that ""Wisconsin demands more than nearly all of the other states"" when it comes to getting a ballot. The National Conference of State Legislatures lists Wisconsin as one of just nine states with ""strict"" photo ID laws used to identify voters. State Rep. Scott Krug, R-Nekoosa, even lauded that status in a Jan. 8 news conference, saying, ""We have one of the hardest ID systems that you can have."" In short, pretty much everyone agrees that Wisconsin’s voter ID law is severe. But there are other elements of the election process that can make it harder for people to vote — and Common Cause Wisconsin didn’t specify in the statement that the group was referring to voter ID alone. So, how does Wisconsin measure up when it comes to other ways to judge voting accessibility? "	1	FAKE	0.3192865
"Wisconsinites will soon have a chance to weigh in on the state’s voter ID law. The April 1 ballot will include a referendum question asking if the voter ID requirement should be enshrined in the state constitution. At a Jan. 8 news conference announcing the referendum, Republicans argued the majority of the public — including in Wisconsin — supports requiring voters to show their ID before getting a ballot. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said the referendum will allow voters an ""opportunity to give us their final say on something that is supported, if you look at any poll, by 70 to 80% of the public."" If the referendum fails, Wisconsin’s voter ID law would still remain in place. If passed, it would elevate the law to the state constitution, making it harder for the state Supreme Court to overturn it or future lawmakers to repeal it. ""The left has chosen one of the most extreme liberals to run for the state Supreme Court,"" Vos added, referring to Susan Crawford, who as an attorney represented plaintiffs challenging the voter ID law. When PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted Vos’ office, his chief of staff, Jenny Toftness, pointed us to two polls, including a nationwide one Gallup released in October 2024. That poll found 84% of the public supports requiring voters to provide photo identification at their polling place, with 15% opposed. That support breaks down into 98% of Republicans who favor voter ID, compared to 84% of independents and 67% of Democrats, Gallup found. The poll randomly sampled more than 1,000 adults living in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, according to its methodology section. PolitiFact Wisconsin also looked at a similar poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, which state Rep. Scott Krug, R-Nekoosa, cited at the news conference. That poll was released in February 2024. That poll showed 81% support requiring government-issued photo identification to vote, with 18% opposed. That includes 95% of Republicans and 69% of Democrats."	1	REAL	0.8228858
"As Congress headed toward a potential pre-Christmas shutdown, some lawmakers warned that closing the government would not save taxpayer money. Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., criticized a push for mass cuts in federal spending by the Department of Government Efficiency, an incoming presidential advisory committee run by entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Musk urged lawmakers to vote against a 1,500-plus page ""continuing resolution"" that would keep the government open. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had negotiated the plan with House Democrats, whose votes he needed to pass it. Ramaswamy described the bill as ""full of excessive spending"" and said it ""should fail."" President-elect Donald Trump and JD Vance, the vice president-elect, rejected the spending deal that would fund the government through mid-March. ""Maybe someone should tell DOGE that government shutdowns aren’t efficient or cost effective?"" Jacobs wrote Dec. 18 on X, using the committee’s self-chosen abbreviation. ""The 2013 and 2018 ones (again led by House Republicans) cost our economy billions of dollars each."" Maybe someone should tell DOGE that government shutdowns aren’t efficient or cost effective?

Government analyses and outside experts say Jacobs has a point that shutdowns can cost the economy, often measured in gross domestic product, billions of dollars. (Gross domestic product is the total monetary value of all goods and services a country produces.) ""Typically there is a shifting of activity across time and an overall loss of GDP in the single digit billions,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. He cautioned, however, that even a shutdown that costs billions of dollars is modest in the context of a $27 trillion-plus U.S. economy. "	1	REAL	0.9661126
"State funding for the University of Wisconsin System was one of the biggest budget battles in 2023, and it’s looking as if 2025 will be no different. The UW System is asking for $855 million from the state Legislature in the upcoming two-year state budget, which lawmakers will craft in the coming months. In November, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said Republicans, who control the Legislature, would not give that large of an amount to the system. ""That’s probably not going to happen,"" Vos told WISN-TV’s ""Upfront."" Appearing Dec. 1 on ""Upfront,"" UW System President Jay Rothman was asked to respond to Vos saying the system was ""(asking) for the moon"" and ""unrealistic.""  ""I look at it from this perspective,"" Rothman said. ""Right now, the Universities of Wisconsin are 43rd out of 50 states in the nation, in terms of public support for our universities. The $855 million gets us up to average.""Rothman said that amount will help universities keep tuition at current levels and keep remaining branch campuses open. ""That’s a reasonable ask,"" he said. Let’s examine Rothman’s claim in two parts. First, does Wisconsin rank 43rd in funding for its public university system? And second, would that $855 million bring Wisconsin closer to the middle of the pack? Does Wisconsin rank 43rd in public higher education funding? PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted the UW System to ask where Rothman got his numbers. Media Relations Director Mark Pitsch pointed us to the State Higher Education Finance report. The national report, produced by the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association, accounts for fiscal year 2023. A chart in the report shows total education revenue per full-time equivalent student — a number that represents tuition dollars plus state support. That’s how the association defines ""public funding.""  The UW System operated under a tuition freeze, as required by the state, for 10 years, Pitsch noted. Wisconsin did land at 43rd in that chart. Only Nevada, Louisiana, West Virginia, New Hampshire, Florida, California and Arkansas provided less per student. Another report from the Wisconsin Policy Forum, released in spring 2023, cited the same, 43rd ranking. PolitiFact Wisconsin reported on this data before, when we checked Democrats’ claims that Republicans were to blame for that low ranking. So, the first part of Rothman’s argument is right. Wisconsin does rank 43rd, providing less funding for public, four-year colleges than most other states."	1	REAL	0.7363572
"Immigration has been one of the toughest issues for Vice President Kamala Harris to address on the campaign trail; her opponent, Donald Trump, has repeatedly spotlighted a spike of illegal immigration under her and President Joe Biden.  But in a recent CNN town hall in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, Harris offered an optimistic data point. ""As of today, we have cut the flow of immigration by over half,"" Harris told moderator Anderson Cooper  Oct. 23.  She’s right. Depending on when you start counting, the drop is well over half. The night of the town hall, Harris’ campaign pointed PolitiFact to official federal government data on encounters at the United States’ southwestern border with Mexico. Encounters are occasions when immigration officials stop someone at the border. A single person could be stopped more than once and counted more than once, and encounters do not mean that the person is let into the U.S. But for understanding migration at the U.S. border, encounters are a standard metric. Border Patrol encounters with migrants between ports of entry at the southwest land border peaked in December 2023 at about 250,000. In September, the latest month with available data and the end of fiscal year 2024, there were about 54,000 encounters. That’s a 78% drop, or more than half, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows. If you start with a different month, the drop is still significant. From September 2023 to September 2024, the number fell from about 219,000 to 54,000, a 75.3% decline.

"Hurricane Helene brought deadly storm surge, heavy winds and torrential rain that caused infrastructure-destroying flooding. As of Oct. 3, the storm and its aftermath had killed more than 190 people across six states and caused at least $20 billion in damage. With the crisis still unfolding, some social media users focused on the federal government’s response — and how that response might change if Republicans win November’s presidential election.  ""FEMA is going to be gutted. It’s written into Project 2025,"" a Sept. 28 Threads video said. Project 2025 will ""cut FEMA"" and ""kill federal-backed flood insurance,"" said similar posts from critics of former President Donald Trump. FEMA refers to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Project 2025 is the conservative Heritage Foundation’s 922-page guide for an incoming Republican administration. Democrats have linked Project 2025 to Trump when attacking its proposals, but the document is neither an official Trump campaign position nor a Republican Party platform. Trump has recently sought to distance himself from Project 2025, but several, high-ranking former Trump administration officials wrote it. Trump said in an April 2022 keynote speech that the Heritage Foundation would ""lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do.""Experts on emergency management and the federal budget said that several of Project 2025’s suggestions constituted significant cuts to FEMA.  Joshua Sewell, research and policy director at the federal budget-tracking group Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Project 2025 lacked necessary detail to evaluate the exact impact of its proposals. ""Changes called for in this piece could ultimately lead to less predictable, more expensive federal disaster response,"" he said. A Project 2025 spokesperson said the plan’s proposals advocate shifting the agency’s focus away from climate change initiatives.Project 2025 mentions FEMA about 30 times. Here’s what it says. The full Project 2025 document mentions FEMA — in shorthand or by its full name — about 30 times, most often in a section written by Ken Cuccinelli, who served as Trump’s acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security. Cuccinelli outlined four primary changes: Changing the cost-share arrangement with local governments so that the federal government often covers 25% instead of at least 75%. Privatizing the National Flood Insurance Program, which provides federally backed flood insurance to property owners and renters in participating communities.Terminating FEMA’s grants. Raising the per capita threshold for providing FEMA public assistance to disaster-stricken communities. The plan also says that FEMA should be moved to the Interior Department or potentially combined with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and both be moved to the Transportation Department. Kathryn Van Tol, a legal fellow of emergency management at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill who once worked in North Carolina’s Division of Emergency Management, said that removing FEMA’s direct access to the Department of Homeland Security’s resources ""could slow response and recovery."""	1	FAKE	0.44676375
"Since Vice President Kamala Harris entered the presidential race, she and former President Donald Trump have sparred over their approaches to lowering prescription drug costs. Harris has described this as an important campaign promise that Trump made but didn’t deliver. ""Donald Trump said he was going to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices,"" Harris said during the ABC News debate on Sept.10 in Philadelphia. ""He never did. We did."" She previously told CNN that Trump’s promise to pursue such negotiations ""never happened"" during his administration. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly promised, if elected, to take steps to allow the government to negotiate drug prices. He never enacted such a policy in office. The Trump administration pursued smaller, temporary programs aimed at lowering drug costs. However, experts say the effect of Trump’s moves fell far short of the expected effect of the Medicare drug price program included in President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act or of what Trump promised.The Inflation Reduction Act — a sweeping climate and health care law Biden signed in August 2022 — included a measure authorizing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to negotiate Medicare’s prescription drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies. ""The idea behind drug price negotiation is that Medicare can use its buying power to get a better price than what is currently being negotiated for these drugs,"" according to Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Medicare covers more than 66 million Americans,  giving it enormous potential influence over prices for U.S. drugs and medical services. In August, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced it had secured significant discounts on the list prices of 10 drugs because of its negotiations. Those discounts ranged from a 38% reduction in cost for blood cancer medication Imbruvica on the low end to a 79% cut for diabetes drug Januvia on the high side. (List prices and the prices Medicare drug plans pay can differ.)The new prices are expected to save Medicare $6 billion in the first year, with Medicare beneficiaries set to save another $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs, according to the White House. Those new prices aren’t set to take effect until 2026 — though Biden and Harris have highlighted other aspects of the law that are bringing down drug costs sooner, such as a $35-per-month out-of-pocket price cap on insulin for Medicare enrollees and a $2,000 yearly out-of-pocket spending cap for Part D drugs effective in January. The Part D program covers most generic and brand-name outpatient prescription drugs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will start negotiating prices for the next group of drugs — 15 per year for the next two years — in early 2025, and those talks will continue annually through the end of the decade."	1	REAL	0.9679148
"Is Wisconsin doubling down on efforts to attract visitors? One Wisconsin lawmaker says funding for the state’s tourism department is up nearly 100 percent. ""The most recent State Budget increased funding for the Department of Tourism by 98 percent,"" state Sen. Rob Cowles, R-Green Bay, said July 12 during the Weekly GOP radio address posted on WisPolitics.com, as he hailed the importance of attracting tourists to the Badger State.  Cowles’ address was made just a few days before the Republican National Convention, held July 15 to July 18, at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee. Cowles referenced the RNC along with the upcoming NFL Draft, set for April 24–26, 2025, in Green Bay as important milestones for Wisconsin’s tourism industry. In his radio address, Cowles pointed out that tourists bring their wallets with them, and the money they spend patronizing local businesses and restaurants makes a difference in local communities and statewide.  We were intrigued by Cowles' claim that funding had nearly doubled. When asked for backup, the state senator’s staff pointed to data from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, a state government agency that provides fiscal and program information and analyses. A summary prepared by the bureau on the state Department of Tourism’s 2023-25 budget shows a table that puts the 2023-25 change at 97.8%. ""For simplicity in the radio address you are referencing, I rounded up to 98% to avoid the need to verbalize decimals in the radio address,"" Cowles wrote in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Also in the email, Cowles explained that tourism spending ensures that more people learn about Wisconsin, and ""When visitors come to Wisconsin, we build a stronger tourism industry, which drives a stronger economy."" The state senator also touted tourism as a ""great return on investment. ""Visitors will spend their money here, leaving funds with small businesses throughout the state and generating additional revenues for local governments and the state government,"" he told PolitiFact in an email.Here is a breakdown of the fiscal bureau’s calculations: Tourism funding for fiscal year 2022-23 is $18,287,700.

"U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said she isn’t buying the Republican presidential ticket’s position on abortion. NBC ""Meet the Press"" host Kristen Welker asked Warren on Aug. 25 what she thought of former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, saying in an earlier interview that Trump wouldn’t sign a federal abortion ban. Warren said, ""American women are not stupid,"" and that the candidates have an anti-abortion track record. ""JD Vance actually sent a letter last year to the Department of Justice saying, ‘enforce the Comstock Act,’"" Warren said. ""And remember, he did that, and then Donald Trump picked him to be his vice president."" The Comstock Act is an 1873 antivice law that bans the mailing of ""obscene"" materials used in abortions. Anti-abortion advocates have tried to resurrect the law to prohibit sending materials such as abortion-inducing medication and surgical equipment. In January 2023, Vance joined about 40 congressional Republicans in sending a letter urging the U.S. Justice Department to enforce the Comstock Act to crack down on mailing abortion pills, which are used in the majority of U.S. abortions. The letter Vance signed was in response to the release of a Justice Department memo saying U.S. law doesn’t prohibit the mailing of abortion medication as long as the sender doesn’t intend for the medication to be used illegally. ""Because there are manifold ways in which recipients in every state may lawfully use such drugs, including to produce an abortion, the mere mailing of such drugs to a particular jurisdiction is an insufficient basis for concluding that the sender intends them to be used unlawfully,"" Christopher Schroeder, assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, wrote in the Dec. 23, 2022, memo. The Justice Department was studying the question after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022 and the U.S. Postal Service asked the department to address whether the Comstock Act criminalizes the mailing of mifepristone, the first pill in a two-drug regimen for a medication abortion.

In  leading the Heritage Foundation, Roberts has promoted Project 2025 and has been called on its leaders and architects by numerous news outlets, including The Associated Press, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Axios and PolitiFact. In his opening to Project 2025’s ""Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise,"" Roberts said that ""The Heritage Foundation is facilitating this work,"" and called it ""an agenda prepared by and for conservatives who will be ready on Day One of the next Administration to save our country from the brink of disaster.""Kevin Roberts, president of The Heritage Foundation, speaks before Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump at the National Religious Broadcasters convention at the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center Thursday, Feb. 22, 2024, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP) When the Heritage Foundation confirmed that Project 2025 Director Paul Dans had stepped down, Roberts took over as the project’s head. Dans served in Trump’s administration in the Office of Personnel Management. Before former President Donald Trump in July selected Vance as his 2024 running mate, Vance touted his involvement in ""Dawn’s Early Light."" ""I was thrilled to write the foreword for this incredible book, which contains a bold new vision for the future of conservatism in America,"" Vance wrote in a June 19 X post. Broadside Books, a HarperCollins imprint that specializes in conservative literature, is publishing the book. At 304 pages, it ""outlines a peaceful ‘Second American Revolution’ for voters looking to shift the power back into the hands of the people,"" the publisher’s description says. ""Dawn’s Early Light"" was originally scheduled to be released in September, but has been postponed to the post-Election-Day date of Nov. 12. Vance’s name is on the book’s cover, according to the publisher’s digital preview. The book’s marketing strategy has changed in recent weeks, however, following an assassination attempt against Trump, heightened pushback against Project 2025 and Vance’s selection for the Republican ticket. The New York Times reported July 31 that Broadside Books removed a downloadable advanced copy of the book that had been made available to reviewers and booksellers, removed from the front cover art that showed an image of a burned out match and swapped out its original subtitle, ""Burning Down Washington to Save America,"" for ""Taking Back Washington to Save America."""	1	FAKE	0.031450883
"Republicans have been attacking Democratic vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s military service, something that traditionally registers as a strength for politicians. After Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign shared a 2018 video clip of Walz discussing gun control, Republicans pounced on the governor’s statement about weapons that he said he carried in war. In the clip, Walz said, ""We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at."" Former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, who, like Walz, is a military veteran, took the governor to task for his comment at an Aug. 7 campaign stop in Shelby Township, Michigan. ""He said, and he was making a point about gun control, that ‘we shouldn’t allow weapons that I used in war to be on America’s streets.’ Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?"" Vance said. ""What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq and he has not spent a day in a combat zone."" We rated Vance’s comment about Walz abandoning his unit Mostly False. The Iraq War was a protracted conflict that spanned 2003 to 2011. During the early years of the war, Walz, who served 24 years in the Army National Guard, eyed retirement and a political career. He submitted retirement paperwork five to seven months before retiring in May 2005 to run for Congress. As he awaited his retirement paperwork’s processing, Walz filed paperwork to run for Congress in February 2005, a month before his battalion received a March notification for a potential deployment to Iraq within two years. Walz’s battalion was officially ordered to deploy to Iraq in July 2005, two months after Walz retired. But was what Vance said about Walz not carrying weapons in combat accurate? Walz first enlisted in the Nebraska National Guard in 1981 days after he turned 17. He transferred to the Minnesota National Guard in 1996, where he served in the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery until he retired in May 2005. The Associated Press reported that Walz was a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard in 1985 when he attended the University of Houston, and that he also served as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard. Walz spent months on active duty deployed overseas, but didn’t serve in Iraq or Afghanistan. He and his battalion deployed to Italy in August 2003 to support U.S. operations in Afghanistan under Operation Enduring Freedom. He returned to Minnesota in April 2004, a Minnesota National Guard spokesperson told PolitiFact. In an email, Lauren Hitt, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson, told PolitiFact that Walz thanked Vance for his service and ""misspoke"" in the 2018 video. ""In making the case for why weapons of war should never be on our streets or in our classrooms, the Governor misspoke,"" Hitt said. ""He did handle weapons of war and believes strongly that only military members trained to carry those deadly weapons should have access to them, unlike Donald Trump and JD Vance who prioritize the gun lobby over our children."""	1	REAL	0.99941224
"U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., in a Fox News interview claimed that Democrats are wrongly trying to portray Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as a moderate. Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, ""is a radical progressive,"" who wants ""open borders,"" Donalds said Aug. 6. ""Tim Walz signed into law driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants in Minnesota, he wanted health care for illegal immigrants in Minnesota, this guy is incredibly left-wing,"" Donalds said. Donalds repeated his claim on X, listing things that he said represented ""The real Tim Walz."" U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn., and social media posts on TikTok and X repeated similar claims about Walz’s record.On March 7, 2023, as Minnesota governor, Walz signed H.F. 4, a bill that expanded access to driver’s licenses to people in the state, regardless of their immigration status. State House and Senate Democrats broadly supported the measure, and only one House Republican supported it. This law reversed a 2003 order by former Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty that barred the state from issuing licenses to people who were in the country illegally. Walz said in March 2023 that the bill would make roads safer and that he was a ""longtime supporter of this bill."" ""Ensuring drivers in our state are licensed and carry insurance makes the roads safer for all Minnesotans,"" Walz said. PolitiFact contacted Donalds’ office, but got no response. The Harris-Walz campaign did not comment. The Minnesota governor’s office did respond, either. About 81,000 people are living illegally in Minnesota, the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank, estimates. Minnesota’s population is about 5.7 million people."	1	REAL	0.5508949
"It’s been around for well over a decade, but it’s still a hot topic in congressional campaigns in 2024: the Affordable Care Act. That’s true in the U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin faces Republican challenger Eric Hovde. ""My opponent wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and kick millions off their health insurance,"" Baldwin said July 23 at Vice President Kamala Harris’ first presidential campaign rally in West Allis. She’s made similar claims before, including in a post on the social media platform X that has nearly a quarter of a million views. Does Hovde want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare? And has his position on the issue changed over the years? When we asked Baldwin’s campaign for backup, communications director Andrew Mamo shared a memo with Hovde’s comments about the Affordable Care Act from 2024, 2017 and 2012. The most recent of those examples was in June of this year, when Hovde was interviewed by WMTV 15, a Madison television station. ""Would you want to repeal the Affordable Care Act?"" the reporter asked. ""Oh, 100%. I think we need to change the Affordable Care Act,"" Hovde answered. Hovde added the ""only thing I think that was worthy in that bill was pre-existing conditions. So, I believe in supporting and keeping pre-existing conditions."" Hovde is referring to the part of the act that says insurers can’t refuse to cover or charge more when people have preexisting conditions: such as multiple sclerosis, which Hovde was diagnosed with in 1991. Baldwin’s campaign also shared clips of Hovde’s remarks in 2017, when he said he would have voted for two Republican bills that would have repealed and replaced the Affordable Care Act.  ""You should push it through. You should get it done because it’s a vast improvement (to) where we are. But is it a perfect bill, absolutely not,"" Hovde told conservative radio host Jerry Bader on WTAQ in June 2017. And in 2012, when he was running in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, Hovde made multiple comments that he’d repeal the law.  One of those instances was during an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editorial board, in which Hovde said he’d repeal the ACA ""in its entirety."" ""I think we need to move back to a free-market approach to solve a lot of these problems. I think we need to break up the mini-monopolies in every single state,"" Hovde said. While those are statements from the past, his comments from June indicate he still wants to repeal the ACA."	1	REAL	0.64577675
"Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, warned that Project 2025, a conservative policy agenda, could spell the end for Head Start, a federally funded program that supports early education and other services for low-income Americans. During a July 18 campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Harris said, ""Their Project 2025 agenda would even end Head Start to take away preschool from hundreds of thousands of our children."" Before and after President Joe Biden’s announcement July 21 that he would forgo a second term, Democrats have been targeting the conservative policy agenda, saying it promotes proposals that would be unpopular with American voters. Some Biden-Harris warnings about Project 2025 have gone too far in describing what the policy blueprint calls for, including exaggerating claims about its impact on Social Security and abortion policy. Other claims are accurate; much of the plan calls for extensive executive branch overhauls and draws on both long-standing conservative principles, such as tax cuts, and more recent culture war issues, such as LGBTQ issues and diversity, equity and inclusion. Project 2025 lays out recommendations for disbanding the Commerce and Education departments, eliminating certain climate protections and consolidating more power to the president. Harris’ claim about ending Head Start, which the Department of Health and Human Services administers, is accurate. On Page 482, the document reads: ""Eliminate the Head Start program.""Two related programs, Head Start and Early Head Start, collectively provide free early childhood education, health and nutrition services for infants, toddlers and preschoolers from low-income families. The programs are federally funded but run by local nonprofit organizations and focus on pregnant women and children up to 5 years old. Head Start was established in 1965 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society initiative. During the 2022-23 school year, the program enrolled about 788,000 children and 13,000 pregnant women. For fiscal year 2024, Congress appropriated $12.27 billion for the Office of Head Start. Approximately two-thirds of program participants are Black or Latino. In 2023, Biden signed an executive order calling on the Department of Health and Human Services to reduce Head Start eligibility barriers and to increase pay and benefits for the program’s teachers and staff. Although a Democratic president enacted the program, lawmakers from both parties have regularly supported Head Start since its creation. During his presidency, Trump’s daughter Ivanka brought attention to early childhood education and convened a panel in Mississippi in 2018 that included a local Head Start official. Head Start tends to be popular with a wide cross section of voters. A July 2023 poll by the Republican firm Public Opinion Strategies on behalf of the First Five Years Fund, a child care advocacy group, found widespread support for Head Start across party lines. When asked whether increases to funding for Head Start and Early Head Start should increase, 71% of Republicans and 89% of Democrats said yes."	1	FAKE	0.1682072
"Black women in the U.S. are “three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women.""As the Biden administration’s most visible advocate in the fight for reproductive rights, Vice President Kamala Harris has been vocal about the U.S.’ reproductive health care’s shortcomings and how it often fails women of color. Harris has toured the nation railing against state abortion bans and touting the administration’s efforts to expand postpartum coverage. In a July 6 conversation at the Essence Festival of Culture, which bills itself as the U.S.’ largest African American culture and music event, Harris said Black women fare the worst in maternal mortality rates. ""Black women in the United States of America are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women,"" Harris said at the New Orleans event. ""And we know that there are a variety of reasons for that. But we also know that this is a health care crisis of the highest order that has received very little attention proportionate to the seriousness of the matter.""  Harris has highlighted this issue before, stating that the U.S. has the highest maternal mortality rate compared with other wealthy nations. She made the same maternal mortality claim July 10, in a speech to Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority members in Dallas. In 2022, we rated a similar statement about the racial disparities in maternal mortality by Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., Mostly True — Warnock added that the disparity existed even when Black women had insurance and income, but we were unable to find studies that controlled for those factors. With the topic coming up recently, we wanted to consult new data to see whether the numbers still hold. They do. The U.S., for years, has had the highest maternal mortality rate among income- comparable countries. Black women in the U.S. also have consistently experienced higher rates — typically between two to four times higher — than other demographics. Munira Gunja, a senior researcher at the Commonwealth Fund, a health care research organization, called the disparity ""unacceptably high."" ""No matter what methodology you use, for Black women it’s much higher,"" Gunja said. ""And the majority of these deaths are preventable."" But gauging and comparing maternal mortality is complicated because of measurement changes in the U.S. and different reporting practices in other countries. Nevertheless, experts said the U.S.’ rate is far too high and remains higher than other wealthy nations, even when adjusting the data. Eugene Declercq, a community health sciences professor at Boston University who runs the birth data website Birth By the Numbers, said there have been efforts to improve consistency in data across countries and, while data comes from different vital statistics systems, they’re fairly comparable. ""There may be individual instances of underreporting in other countries, but most have data systems as good or better than the U.S.,"" he said. ""The issue around measurement doesn't get the U.S.’ poor performance off the hook."""	1	FAKE	0.4850645
"Vice President Kamala Harris has attracted heightened attention, including from critics and the media, amid continued bipartisan questions about President Joe Biden’s fitness for office after his roundly criticized debate performance June 27. On July 7, during ""Fox News Sunday,"" host Shannon Bream asked Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., about former President Donald Trump possibly running against Harris, rather than Biden, in November. Donalds expressed confidence that Trump would find material to use against Harris in the campaign. Donalds told Bream that Harris had ""co-sponsored, fully sponsored this radical Green New Deal, which will cost the American people $100 trillion."" We previously rated False the notion that the Green New Deal, a proposal backed by some Democrats when it was unveiled in 2019, would cost $100 trillion. We contacted Donalds’ office for evidence but received no reply.However, we confirmed through public documentation that Harris did co-sponsor Senate legislation backing the Green New Deal and, to date, still supports the measure’s principles.What was the Green New Deal? Legislation proposing a Green New Deal was introduced Feb. 7, 2019, in both the House and the Senate, following months of discussion among progressive lawmakers and activists. As we noted then, these resolutions addressed ways to curb climate change and protect the environment, including achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, building smart power grids, and upgrading existing buildings to maximize energy efficiency. Beyond the environment, the proposal addressed topics including racial justice, labor union policy and higher education. The resolutions were aspirational in nature, without specific details and with no new taxes or revenue streams to fund the shift, other than an expression of confidence that these changes will pay for themselves.  The Green New Deal never gained universal support even among Democratic lawmakers, and in the Democratic-controlled House, party leaders never brought it to a vote. Meanwhile, as a resolution, the legislation would not have had the force of law even if both chambers had passed it, which they didn’t. Even so, the proposal’s mere existence became a frequent talking point for Republicans, who warned that it would empower big government to infringe on Americans’ liberty and would cost taxpayers too much money. What Harris said about the Green New Deal Despite the Republican opposition, the proposal remained popular within the Democratic base, including with people who were poised to vote in the Democrats’ 2020 presidential primary. A significant number of Democrats who were running for president supported it, including Harris. The future vice president, who had formally announced her presidential bid just weeks before the resolution was introduced, was joined on the list of original Senate co-sponsors by several other 2020 presidential candidates, including Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. (Co-sponsorship means full support for a piece of legislation, alongside multiple other members.) In a Medium post published the day the Senate introduced its resolution, Harris wrote that she was ""proud"" to have signed on as an original Senate co-sponsor. ""For too long, we have been governed by lawmakers who are beholden to big oil and big coal,"" Harris wrote. ""They have refused to act on climate change. So it’s on us to speak the truth, rooted in science fact, not science fiction."" Harris closed by writing, ""We do not fight this fight for our generation alone — but for generations to come. Thank you for taking direct action today."""	1	FAKE	0.028696988
"As President Joe Biden ramps up efforts to win over Wisconsin voters, one of Milwaukee’s leading Democratic officials lauded the gains Black Americans made under the Biden administration. On May 16, during an event for Vice President Kamala Harris, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley claimed: ""Under (the Biden) administration we have witnessed the fastest growth of black-owned small businesses in more than 30 years."" Let’s dig into the numbers. Crowley quoting the White House? What Crowley said might have sounded very familiar. Why? In early 2023, Biden spoke of the record numbers of new Black entrepreneurs during campaign speeches Jan. 27 in South Carolina and Feb. 4 in Las Vegas. The White House even released a factsheet discussing similar claims Feb. 6. Here’s what the fact sheet laid out: Since the President entered office, a record 16 million new business applications have been filed, and the share of Black households owning a business has more than doubled. Building on this momentum, the Biden-Harris Administration has: Achieved the fastest creation rate of Black-owned businesses in more than 30 years — and more than doubled the share of Black business owners from 2019 to 2022. PolitiFact National did an earlier fact-check on the Biden administration’s statements on Black entrepreneurs from the fact sheet and rated it True. Census Bureau and the Federal Reserve Board datasets found record levels of Black business ownership in 2021 and 2022. Independent analyses say that some of Biden’s policies likely played a role.

"It’s not a stretch to say Wisconsin tourism is having a moment. Season 21 of ""Top Chef,"" which just finished airing, gave viewers a glimpse of Wisconsin’s traditions. Business boomed at Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin in Spring Green after it was featured in an episode. In a few weeks, the Republican National Convention will blanket Milwaukee, bringing thousands of delegates, politicians, staff and media who will spend money on entertainment, hotels and restaurants. And don’t forget about next April, when an estimated 240,000 visitors will come to Green Bay and surrounding cities for the National Football League draft. An economic impact of $94 million is the early projection.  That boom isn’t lost on Wisconsin politicians, especially Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who has frequently hyped up a ""record-breaking year"" for tourism in posts on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. ""Wisconsin saw another record-breaking year for tourism, with a historic $25 billion economic impact in 2023,"" Evers posted June 11. ""That blows 2022's record year out of the water."" On June 22, Evers also called out ""Wisconsin's record-breaking year for tourism"" and credited outdoor recreation opportunities. PolitiFact Wisconsin was interested in these numbers, because tourism will surely continue to be a hot topic in Wisconsin in the months ahead. $25 billion is clearly a large number, but what goes into the formula to generate that economic impact? Is it spread throughout the state, or only in cities? And how does it compare to past years? In short, is Evers right that it’s record-breaking? Let’s take a look. Outside report calculates visitor spending and other variables to reach $25 billion number The $25 billion number Evers is referring to comes from the Tourism Economics Report, which is available on the Wisconsin Department of Tourism website. The report was created by Tourism Economics — a company of global advisory firm Oxford Economics — not the state itself. The methodology explains the firm used a model to trace the ""flow of visitor-related expenditures through the state’s economy and their effects on employment, wages, and taxes."" Visitors were considered people who stayed overnight on a trip or traveled more than 50 miles to a destination. Multiple data sources were used, such as from surveys and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. With that said, let’s take a closer look at how they calculated the $25 billion total impact. A large portion of that number — $15.7 billion — comes from direct visitor spending on things like lodging, food and beverage, retail, entertainment and transportation. Then there’s about $4.6 billion in what’s called supply-chain effects, such as needing to purchase more from food wholesalers and utilities. Finally, there’s $4.7 billion in ""induced impacts"" — which refers to wages that are generated directly or indirectly by visitor spending and spent in the local economy. That gives a picture of what goes into the $25 billion: It’s more than just the raw amount that visitors are spending in Wisconsin. Is that impact equally felt in the state? The tourism department said all of Wisconsin’s 72 counties saw an increase in their total economic impact number from 2022 to 2023. A spreadsheet of county-level data confirms that. The top five counties with the highest economic impact, in millions, were Milwaukee, Dane, Sauk, Waukesha and Brown.  Interestingly, popular tourism destination Door County ranked eighth at $620 million, far below Milwaukee’s $4.17 billion. The counties with the lowest economic impact from tourism were Menominee, Florence, Pepin, Forest and Lafayette. Those ranged from $6 million to $29 million in impacts. The counties that saw the highest growth in their total economic impact from 2022 to 2023 were Monroe, Menominee, and Green Lake. They saw increases from 10 to 11 percent each. "	1	FAKE	0.119441114
"After a jury found former President Donald Trump guilty on 34 felony counts, some social media users pointed to how this conviction affects his Second Amendment rights. A May 30 X post said, ""Under federal law, Trump's felony convictions mean he can no longer possess guns."" Other social media posts made similar claims, drawing more than 1,000 engagements each. Giffords Law Center, which advocates for gun violence prevention; Jobin Joseph, an attorney with New York law firm Rosenblum Law; and Adam Winkler, a University of California, Los Angeles, law professor, told PolitiFact this statement is accurate. Federal law generally prohibits the possession of firearms by, and the sale of firearms to, a person convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment of more than one year — typically a felony.Because of these felony convictions, Trump is also barred from possessing a gun under state laws in Florida, where he lives, and in New York, where he was convicted, according to Giffords Law Center. People convicted of a felony in New York can have their gun rights restored in some cases. Because Trump’s 34 felony counts were all Class E, meaning they are less severe crimes, he would be eligible for gun rights restoration. To restore his gun rights, Trump could apply for a ""Certificate of Relief from Disabilities"" so long as his 34 felony counts are considered part of the same criminal occurrence, Joseph said.If Trump were convicted of additional felonies in another court case, Joseph said, then he would have to take a different approach and apply for a ""Certificate of Good Conduct,"" after a waiting period dependent on the crime’s severity. Trump was not convicted of these felony counts in Florida, so he could not regain his gun rights under that state’s law. In a 2012 Washington Times interview, Trump said that he had a concealed carry permit in New York City and he owns ""a couple of different guns,"" including a ""H&K (Heckler & Koch) .45 and a .38 Smith & Wesson."" In 2016, Trump told a French publication that he ""always"" carries a weapon. It’s unclear whether Trump still owns firearms. In 2023, Trump visited a gun store in South Carolina, but did not buy any firearms. We rate the claim that under federal law, Trump’s ""felony convictions mean he can no longer possess guns"" True."	1	REAL	0.7753439
"As President Joe Biden runs for reelection, Republicans have argued that he’s responsible for high levels of crime. Biden has responded by saying that violent crime has actually fallen on his watch. In May 15 remarks at a national police memorial service at the U.S. Capitol, Biden told officers and other attendees, ""You risk your lives every day for the safety of the people you don’t even know. That’s why each of you, each and every one of you, is a hero. It’s no accident that violent crime is near a record 50-year low."" Official FBI data on crime tends to lag, but available measures show overall violent crime has fallen during Biden’s presidency. But is violent crime ""near a record 50-year low,"" as Biden said? We checked the FBI data and found that he’s on target. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.Four types of crime comprise the FBI’s definition of violent crime: homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Over the past six decades, the FBI’s methodology has changed in small ways that make such long-term comparisons apples-to-oranges. Notably, the FBI changed its definition for rape in 2013 to expand the types of physical contact that are considered rape. This means recent data on rape shows more cases, making the overall violent crime rate higher than under the old definition. To test Biden’s claim, we used a set of FBI crime data assembled by Jeff Asher, an analyst for AH Datalytics. Asher collected the data from 1960 to 2022, using data for the original definition of rape to enable an apples-to-apples comparison across time. Viewed broadly, the violent crime rate rose through the 1970s and 1980s, peaking in 1991 and falling since, according to his analysis. The rate has had a few upward blips, notably during the coronavirus pandemic, but it remains far lower than it was at its early 1990s peak. There are two ways to determine which time span to use when analyzing the FBI data. It could cover either the 50 years from 1972 to 2022 (the most recent 50 years available in full-year FBI data) or the 48 years from 1974 to 2022 (using 1974 because it was 50 years from when Biden made the claim). A note: The FBI changed how police departments report crime to the agency in 2021. Some large police departments, such as New York City and Los Angeles, did not change their reporting processes in time for the 2021 data deadline. Although that creates a larger margin of uncertainty for the FBI’s 2021 data, the agency always estimates non-reporting cities’ crime levels based on similar jurisdictions that did report. Through these estimates, all cities are reflected in the data. In addition, crime statistics experts told PolitiFact that the FBI’s 2021 data tracks other crime data studies that didn’t change their methodology that year. The FBI’s 2022 data was not affected. We looked at the FBI data analyzed by Asher for both time spans, and using either one, Biden is right that the 2022 data is ""near"" a 50-year low. In 1972, there were 401 violent crimes per 100,000 population; in 1974, there were 461 violent crimes per 100,000 population. Both of those data points are higher than the 2022 figure of just under 370 violent crimes per 100,000 residents. 2022 would have been the absolute lowest year of the past 50 for violent crime except for two marginal drops below the 2022 level, in 2014 and 2019. (In both of those years, the violent crime rate was 364 per 100,000)."	1	REAL	0.63603574
"Is the U.S. an outlier when it comes to paid leave? At least one Wisconsin state lawmaker says it is.  ""The United States is an outlier, one of only about half a dozen countries, without any guarantee of paid leave for new parents and/or other health care needs,"" state Rep. Lisa Subeck, D-Madison, said Feb. 16 on X. The statement was in support of a bill introduced by Democrats in the state Legislature to establish a paid family and medical leave insurance program in Wisconsin. ""With businesses across the state facing a shortage of workers, we must find ways to attract a talented and competitive workforce,"" Subeck said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""A comprehensive paid family and medical leave policy in Wisconsin would be a game changer for businesses, for workers, and for our families."" Let’s look at the issue of guaranteed leave for new parents — and whether the U.S. is an outlier when compared to other countries. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) requires 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually for parents of newborn or newly adopted children if the parents work for a company with 50 or more employees. In 2020 the policy was extended to caregivers of sick family members. FMLA applies only to unpaid leave. What about paid leave? The Federal Employee Paid Leave Act of 2019 prvides a paid parental leave benefit to most (but not all) civilian employees who work for the federal government. Also, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, 13 states and the District of Columbia have enacted mandatory paid family leave systems. An additional eight states have voluntary systems that provide paid family leave through private insurance.Each of those, in their own ways, provides leave — but none is a national paid parental leave program. Policy analysis When asked to support the statement, Subeck pointed to a The New York Times article that obtained much of its data from the World Policy Analysis Center at UCLA. The policy analysis notes that paid leave available to mothers includes both paid maternity leave, which is leave reserved for mothers of infants, and paid shared parental leave — which is leave available to either parent of an infant.  It is important to note that although not required to do so, many employers provide paid leave for their employees. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, from 27% to 30% of workers were provided paid family leave by their employers in 2023. There is data for paid leave reserved for mothers of infants and for shared parental leave. The policy analysis center data reflects a review of laws in place as of January 2022 In the data illustrating paid leave available to mothers of infants, only two countries — the United States and Papua New Guinea — were in the category of no paid leave.

But when Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming claimed in a media call during Vice President Kamala Harris’ March 6 visit that ""We’ve had 12 elections in 24 years in Wisconsin that have been decided by less than 30,000 votes,"" it struck us as a lot. So, we decided to dig into the numbers. Close calls for a handful of statewide races When PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted state GOP spokesman Matt Fisher to determine which races Schimming was referring to, he supplied a list of 12. PolitiFact confirmed the results from those races with the Wisconsin Elections Commission election results archive and added the vote margin. This is how the races played out in the last 24 years:2000 presidential – Republican candidate George W. Bush narrowly defeated Vice President Al Gore by 5,708 votes. 2004 presidential – Bush won again, beating out Democratic ticket of then-U.S. Sen. John Kerry by 11,384 votes. 2006 attorney general – Republican J.B. Van Hollen defeated then-Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk by 8,859 votes. 2008 Wisconsin Supreme Court – Conservative Michael J. Gableman secured victory against incumbent Justice Louis Butler with a 22,303 vote margin. 2011 Wisconsin Supreme Court – The incumbent justice, conservative David Prosser Jr., won a second 10-year term after defeating assistant Wisconsin Attorney General JoAnne Kloppenburg by 7,004 votes. 2016 presidential – Republican Donald Trump beat out former secretary of state and first lady of the United States Hillary Clinton by 22,784 votes. 2018 gubernatorial – Incumbent Republican Gov. Scott Walker lost his run for a third term after being defeated by Democratic challenger and then-Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers. Evers won with a 29,227 vote margin. 2018 attorney general race – Current Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, defeated Republican incumbent Brad Schimel by 17,190 votes. 2019 Wisconsin Supreme Court – Former Appeals Judge Brian Hagedorn defeated then-Appeals Chief Judge Lisa Neubauer with a 5,981 vote gap.2020 presidential – The race saw current President and then-former Vice President Joe Biden beat incumbent Republican President, Donald Trump by 20,608 votes. 2022 U.S. Senate – Incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson won his re-election to a third term after defeating Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes by 26,718 votes. 2022 secretary of state – Incumbent Democrat Doug La Follette narrowly beat out Republican state legislator Amy Loudenbeck. He won a 12th term in office with a 7,442 vote margin. It’s worth noting that only two presidential contests in the last 24 years did not have close calls: 2008 and 2012. In those two election years, former President Barack Obama won by 414,818 and 213,019 votes, respectively."	1	REAL	0.90798646
"U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin spoke about the fentanyl crisis in a March 7 media call ahead of the State of the Union, alongside the Waukesha police chief, who attended President Joe Biden’s speech with Baldwin. Fentanyl is an extremely powerful synthetic opioid, known for its ability to kill in small doses. The drug is commonly mixed into drugs such as heroin and cocaine, but can also be found in pressed pills and even in marijuana, police say.PolitiFact has looked at claims regarding fentanyl and accidental overdoses before, when envelopes containing unknown substances were sent to elections officials in 2023. According to a Nov. 10, 2023, fact-check, although fentanyl is dangerous, and it can be lethal in small doses, it must enter the bloodstream to have an effect. The drug isn’t absorbed well by the skin, meaning it must be snorted through the nose, ingested or injected with a needle. People also cannot get sick by being in a room with powdered fentanyl, because it doesn’t easily vaporize. A source in the fact check said to cause toxicity from breathing it in, ""You would probably have to be in a wind tunnel with dunes of fentanyl around you."" But people can get sick if they touch the drug and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes.In 2022, there were over 1,400 opioid-related deaths in Wisconsin, many of them tied to fentanyl, according to a February 2024 PolitiFact. During the call, Baldwin made a claim that initially had us — and probably others — scratching our heads:  ""We’re facing situations these days where you have to have two officers in the evidence room in case there’s an accidental (fentanyl) exposure. We are facing situations where first responders have been exposed to fentanyl at the crime scene and that is scary and we need to provide the support, the tools, the test strips, and all the training necessary to keep our first responders safe so that they can keep all of us safe."" Why would two officers need to be present to test a drug? Is it a safety precaution or something else? Many agencies have policies to have two officers present during drug analysis When we asked Baldwin’s team about the claim, press secretary Alanna Conley pointed us toward the Sheboygan County Sheriff’s Department, which recently shared its policies with Baldwin. Sheriff Cory Roeseler said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin that several years ago someone was exposed during testing of a suspected narcotic, which ended up having fentanyl in it. ""As a result our testing procedure changed. First we started using two officers, one in the room where the drugs are being tested and one outside the room in the event that there was an exposure,"" he said.  ""Second we purchased a specific chamber to use to test the drugs so that it might limit any potential exposure and this chamber is vented/filtered. Lastly, we have Narcan readily available in our testing area in the event that there was an exposure where it might be needed."" He said there have been exposures for at least one deputy, who was transporting a drug in to be processed, and another for a corrections officer, who was exposed during booking and had to be hospitalized. The Sheboygan sheriff’s department isn’t the only agency that uses two people when narcotics are being handled.  Jim Palmer, a member of the Board of Directors for the Wisconsin Law Enforcement Accreditation Group, said in an email that ""the practice of having two individuals work in an evidence room as a safety precaution has become increasingly common."" He said that a second person can be used in handling certain types of dangerous evidence, according to standards created by the group. The standards also recommend the use of gloves, a respirator, a fume hood and having naloxone available.  Palmer pointed to the Madison Police Department, whose guidance takes the standards into account. "	1	FAKE	0.3648737
"At a rally in suburban Waukesha earlier this month, first lady Jill Biden and other Democratic officials laid out what’s at stake in the 2024 election, focusing on abortion and health care access. Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski was one of the speakers who took the stage before the first lady, asking a crowd of mostly women voters to talk to their neighbors and help get out the vote. ""When it comes to how many votes (President) Joe Biden won, it was literally less than a few votes per ward,"" Godlewski said.  We often mention that Biden won Wisconsin in 2020 by a little more than 20,000 votes. But taking a look at the votes by ward could give an interesting picture of how competitive the election was – and could be again this fall. And other Democrats seem to be repeating the same message, including when Biden visited his new campaign headquarters in Milwaukee. ""In Wisconsin, every election comes down to three to four votes per ward,"" the state party’s Deputy Organizing Director Jaliah Jefferson said at that event. As the state heads for a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump, let’s look at how many votes it came down to by ward last time. Number came from dividing votes by total number of wards in Wisconsin When we asked for backup, Nathan Schwantes, Godlewski’s chief of staff, said the secretary of state was talking about the entire state of Wisconsin, not a specific city or county. He explained that Biden won the state by 20,682 votes (which is correct) and that Wisconsin had 6,656 wards where voters lived. That division results in 3.1 votes per ward. He added that there’s a slightly different count of wards in Wisconsin, which includes wards where no voters live. That number was 7,078, giving a result of 2.9 voters. State law says that wards are the ""building blocks"" for creating districts for local, state and federal offices. And ""all territory, even if unpopulated, must be contained in a ward."" That explains why some wards might not actually have voters in them. Schwantes shared an email from the nonpartisan Legislative Technology Services Bureau, which confirms the 7,078 number. That total was from July, because the next count was not taken until January. Whichever total ward number is used, the calculations result in around a few votes per ward. So, Godlewski’s math is correct. Calculation takes wards together as an average, though certain areas voted differently Wards vary widely in population. And blue areas of the state would have delivered many more votes for Biden per ward, and red areas would have delivered much less. For example, Biden lost Waukesha County to Trump — where Godlewski made the claim — by 55,743 votes.  Looking at the ward-by-ward report of 2020 presidential results, Waukesha County had about 387 wards, so that comes down to about 144 votes per ward that Biden lost by."	1	FAKE	0.4567668
"In Gaza, experts and journalists say, food is running out. Some people are making ""bread"" from animal feed ground into flour or ""soup"" from water and weeds, according to news reports. But even those food sources are being exhausted, warned experts who evaluate food insecurity and famine. ""Palestinians in Gaza are enduring horrifying levels of hunger and suffering,"" United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said March 18. ""This is the highest number of people facing catastrophic hunger ever recorded by the Integrated Food Security Classification system — anywhere, anytime."" “Palestinians in Gaza are enduring horrifying levels of hunger and suffering” – UN Secretary-General António Guterres “We must act now to prevent the unthinkable, the unacceptable and the unjustifiable”A March 18 report by a group of international organizations that evaluate global food emergencies found that ""famine is imminent"" in parts of Gaza. Using the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system, the report estimated that from mid-March to mid-July, 1.1 million people — about half of the Gazan population — will face ""catastrophic"" food insecurity, when starvation, death and ""extremely critical acute malnutrition levels"" are evident. From Feb. 15 to March 15, the report said, 677,000 people in Gaza faced ""catastrophic"" levels of food insecurity. The Israel-Hamas war and ""extremely limited"" access for humanitarian groups to provide aid within Gaza are driving the hunger crisis, the report said.Guterres’ statement is specific and accurate. We found no instances since the tracking system’s creation about two decades ago in which more people in one place were classified as experiencing ""catastrophic"" hunger or famine. At the same time, his statement might have left some listeners, particularly those unfamiliar with this 20-year-old global tracking system, wondering how the Gaza situation compares with other hunger crises throughout history.  We contacted Guterres and a spokesperson with the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system and received no reply. Data and experts backed Guterres’ statement. Ron Dermer, minister for strategic affairs in Israel, on March 26 disputed the report of imminent famine. The global food insecurity evaluation system The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system Guterres referred to, created in 2004, is used to classify ""the severity and magnitude of food insecurity and malnutrition"" globally. The system, sometimes called IPC, is described as the main tool the international community uses to analyze data and determine whether famine is happening or projected to occur in a country. In January, Arif Husain, the United Nations World Food Program chief economist, explained how IPC analysis reports are produced.  ""This is an exercise that has about 23 partners, including 19 U.N. agencies and international (nongovernmental organizations) and about four donors,"" Husain told The New Yorker. He said the group’s findings are independent and a consensus-based analysis. When have the worst levels of food insecurity been reported? The IPC’s system classifies acute food insecurity in five phases, with 1 meaning ""none/minimal,"" to 5, meaning ""catastrophe/famine."" Since the system’s creation, food insecurity levels have rarely reached phase 5 in any country. The IPC’s ""catastrophic"" phase 5 classification applies to households experiencing extreme lack of food. A phase 5 ""famine"" classification applies to an area in which at least 1 in 5 households face ""catastrophic"" food insecurity, and malnutrition and mortality are acute. IPC has classified two situations in the last 10 years as ""famine"": In 2011, in parts of southern Somalia about 490,000 people experienced catastrophic food insecurity because of conflict and drought. In 2017, almost 80,000 people in parts of South Sudan faced acute food insecurity because of three years of civil war, economic hardship and high food prices.  Somalia was the ""clearest case in recent decades,"" and ""Gaza has surpassed those numbers today,"" wrote Alex de Waal, the World Peace Foundation executive director, following the March IPC report’s release.  In January, de Waal said the IPC phase 5 designation ""is exceptional and rare."" Based on the information we could find, 677,000 people facing catastrophic hunger, as the report said they are in Gaza, is unprecedented. We searched Google and Nexis, a database of news reports, and found other instances in which acute food insecurity reached phase 5 catastrophic levels, even if the IPC did not designate a famine. These included: In June 2021, 353,000 people in Ethiopia. (The Ethiopian government disputed the analysis.) In March 2022, 31,000 people in Yemen.In May 2022, 20,000 people in Afghanistan. In October 2022, 19,000 people in Haiti.In November 2023, 35,000 people in South Sudan. Beth Bechdol, the Food and Agriculture Organization’s deputy director general, told The Washington Post that, as of the March report, Gaza has the largest percentage of a population to receive its most severe rating since the IPC began reporting in 2004. The report said 30% of Gaza’s population is currently in phase 5. The World Peace Foundation’s de Waal, who wrote the book ""Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine,"" told PolitiFact that someone would have to look back to before World War II to find incidents of food insecurity ""of comparable intensity.""

"Two of the five Great Lakes — Erie and Ontario — border New York state. And a New York state legislator recently touted the lakes’ importance to the continent’s and the world’s water supply. New York State Assembly member Patrick Burke, whose Buffalo-area district almost touches Lake Erie, introduced a bill this month that would create a ""Great Lakes Bill of Rights"" to give residents ""a role in the decision-making process regarding current and future projects that impact the ecosystem."" In a press release introducing the bill, Burke wrote that the Great Lakes account for ""over 20% of the world’s freshwater and over 80% of North America’s freshwater."" Official data says Burke is correct. Burke’s office did not answer a request for comment.How great are the lakes? Besides Erie and Ontario, the Great Lakes include Superior, Michigan and Huron to the west. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Great Lakes account for 21% of the world’s freshwater and 84% of North America's surface fresh water. That’s in line with what Burke said. Such percentages may sound like a lot, but Joseph Atkinson, the director for the Great Lakes Program at the University at Buffalo, told PolitiFact that even such large reserves cannot last indefinitely without careful conservation. ""if you start diverting the water from the Great Lakes to other areas of the U.S., depending on how much is moved, they won’t be able to provide as much fresh water as they would if the water remained where it was,"" Atkinson said. If the water being removed ""exceeds the water coming in, the water levels will drop indefinitely."" Besides providing fresh drinking water, the Great Lakes provide energy through hydroelectric power. The Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station and the Lewiston Pump Generating Plant are New York State’s two largest hydroelectric power plants, according to the New York Power Authority. Both are near Niagara Falls, which is formed by the Niagara River; the Niagara River carries water from Lake Erie into Lake Ontario.""The hydroelectric power plant at Niagara Falls was one of the first in the country, and it's still a pretty large contributor to New York's power supply,"" Atkinson said. Conservation efforts The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, signed April 15, 1972, involved pledges by Canada and the United States to protect the Great Lakes. The agreement sets limits on phosphorus levels flowing into the lakes. Too much phosphorus would make the lakes subject to too much growth by algae and other invasive plants, Atkinson said. ""It's very important to conserve the Great Lakes,"" Atkinson said. The lakes, he said, ""are essential to our existence.""Burke said the Great Lakes account for ""over 20% of the world’s freshwater and over 80% of North America’s freshwater.""

"Migrants crossing into the United States from the southern border get many headlines, but there has also been an increase in crossings at the U.S.-Canada border. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who represents a geographically large district in the North Country and Adirondack Park, said on Fox News that the number of illegal crossings is many times higher than it has been in the past. ""We’ve seen an 800% increase in the Swanton sector, which is the part of the northern border that I represent, in illegal crossings,"" Stefanik said Jan 28 on ""Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.""   We wondered if there has been an increase of 800% in illegal crossings. The Swanton sector includes an estimated 24,000 square miles and includes northeastern counties in New York, three counties in New Hampshire and all of Vermont. It is responsible for 295 miles of the U.S.-Canada border, over land and water. Year-over-year increases in illegal crossings have been steady since the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, 2020, rising from just 365 that year to 1,065 in the next fiscal year, which ended in September 2022. In fiscal year 2023, the number of people encountered at the border jumped to 6,925, representing the largest year-over-year increase so far. However, if current trends continue, 2024 will outpace the jump in 2023. In the first three months of fiscal year 2024, there have been 2,607 crossings, compared with 1,147 during the same period last year. Within this data, there are different time periods in which to calculate the increase, all yielding different results. Stefanik could have seen a U.S. Customs and Border Protection news release from February 2023, which stated that there had been an approximate 846% increase in encounters and apprehensions between Oct. 1, 2022, and Jan. 31, 2023, compared with the same period in fiscal year 2022.  In November, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Chief Patrol Agent Robert N. Garcia of the Swanton sector posted on X that there had been a 550% increase in apprehensions between fiscal year 2022 and 2023, and that the migrants came from 79 countries. Garcia posted in August that apprehensions in just over 10 months exceeded the previous nine years combined.Experts we spoke with found that the increases, while large for the northern border, are small when compared to other places on the northern border, or the southern border, which has many more crossings. ""Percentages can look really big, but the numbers themselves can be quite small,"" said Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Buffalo Field Office, which operates ports of entry in Erie and Niagara counties, has many more encounters, 84,429 in fiscal year 2023, or 12 times more than the Swanton sector. ""Encounters"" are people seeking admission who are not authorized to do so. Along the entire southern border during 2023, there were more than 6,700 encounters per day on average, or 2.48 million total. Immigration experts caution that the number of encounters at a border is not the same thing as the number of people who tried to cross, because the same person could try to cross more than once. But Stefanik said crossings, not people.  Are these illegal crossings? Any crossing of the border without prior authorization is an illegal entry, but people have a right to ask for asylum, saying they have a fear of returning to their home country, Putzel-Kavanaugh said. These asylum seekers are released with a charge that they entered illegally. When they ask for asylum, they can defend their charge with the reasons why they are seeking asylum. "	1	FAKE	0.342548
"When Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., shared a newsletter with constituents recently, she made the first item of business federal marijuana policy. In the Feb. 3 newsletter, Gillibrand wrote that ""marijuana is currently classified in the same category of drugs as heroin and a more dangerous category than fentanyl or cocaine."" Gillibrand is correct about marijuana’s federal status. That decades-old classification clashes with the drug’s widespread state-level legalization in recent years. Four states fully outlaw marijuana for medical or recreational use: Idaho, Kansas, South Carolina and Wyoming. Seven more states allow the marijuana derivative CBD but not marijuana itself. By contrast, every other state has fully legalized marijuana for recreational and/or medical use or removed criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of the drug.So, why does the federal government still consider marijuana to ""have no medical use"" and believe it has ""the highest potential for disorder and abuse""? Marijuana as a Schedule I drug The federal government’s schedule system stems from the Controlled Substances Act, which was enacted in 1970. The schedules run from 1 (for drugs that have the most serious risk of abuse) down to 5 (which are the least likely to be misused). Gillibrand is correct that cocaine and fentanyl both fall within Schedule 2, which covers drugs ""considered dangerous"" and have ""a high potential for abuse."" Under federal scheduling, the legitimate medical use for cocaine is that it can be used during certain eye surgeries under controlled dosages. Heroin, meanwhile, is considered a Schedule 1 drug, along with marijuana. Other Schedule 1 drugs include LSD and ecstasy.Although states have increasingly passed laws to legalize marijuana for medical and recreational use, fatal poisonings from fentanyl have skyrocketed, particularly from contamination within other dangerous drugs. PolitiFact recently rated True the statement that the United States has seen ""more Americans die of fentanyl than the Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam wars, combined."" Still, marijuana is more potent than it used to be, with the highest concentrations of THC, the main psychoactive ingredient, found in concentrated cannabis products. Marijuana potency has increased from 4% THC in 1995 to 17% in 2017, and at one dispensary in California, a strain of cannabis that could be smoked had 41% THC, according to KFF Health News. What does Gillibrand support? Gillibrand’s office told PolitiFact she supports a full descheduling of marijuana but would also consider a rescheduling to a lower level as an alternative. Gillibrand was one of eight co-sponsors of the Marijuana Justice Act, which several Democratic senators introduced in the 2019-20 congressional session. The bill would have removed marijuana from the list of controlled substances. Her office added that moving marijuana away from Schedule 1 would enable more research, because Schedule 1 drugs are subject to greater restrictions on medical and scientific study. Gillibrand also argues that changing marijuana’s status would help ease operations for marijuana-based businesses and unclog court dockets.What is the outlook for federal rescheduling or descheduling? Mason Tvert, a marijuana policy specialist with VSStrategies, a Denver-based cannabis consulting company, said the federal government has already taken limited steps toward rescheduling marijuana. In August 2023, the federal Department of Health and Human Services recommended that the Drug Enforcement Administration reschedule cannabis from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3, though the recommendation’s full text was not released. In January, the department released a 252-page, unredacted copy of the text in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. "	1	FAKE	0.02670518
"During an interview with Noticias Univision, Vice President Kamala Harris touted the Biden administration’s efforts to extend postpartum Medicaid care. ""When I came in as vice president, only three states extended postpartum care Medicaid coverage to 12 months. I issued a call and a challenge to all states. And now 43 states have extended postpartum care for women,"" she said Jan. 29. Postpartum health insurance covers a critical period for recovering from childbirth, which the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services says includes addressing complications of delivery, ensuring mental health, managing infant care, and transitioning from obstetric to primary care. Federal law previously required states to provide pregnancy-related Medicaid coverage until 60 days postpartum. Then, 2021 legislation temporarily gave states the option to extend that coverage to a full calendar year. Legislation in 2022 gave states the option to make the extension permanent. States offer this coverage using federal funding and the state’s own funding.Health experts told PolitiFact that Harris’ claim — on the numbers she cited and the administration’s role — was correct. Coverage increased from three to 43 states When contacted for comment, Harris’ office sent PolitiFact two sources to support the vice president’s claim. The first was a Medicaid Postpartum Coverage Extension Tracker from KFF, a health policy research and analysis organization. It shows that 43 states have extended Medicaid coverage to 12 months postpartum.  Harris’ office also shared U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information showing that when the Biden administration took office in January 2021, Illinois, New Jersey and Virginia were the only states in which Medicaid subsidized 12 months of postpartum coverage. Did the Biden administration influence the expansion? Yes, different laws that Biden signed gave states an easier pathway and some federal funding for this expansion. States still partially fund the care, as they had before the expansion. The 2021 American Rescue Plan that President Joe Biden signed into law enabled states to temporarily extend Medicaid coverage to 12 months postpartum. The extension began April 1, 2022, and ended in May 2023. KFF reported that before April 2022, states that wanted to use federal money to expand postpartum care had to do so through a section 1115 waiver. The waiver lets states divert funds from what’s required by federal statutes and try new approaches for administering Medicaid. But the waivers allowed only for temporary changes, not permanent. States could also use only state money to expand postpartum programs, rather than go through the waiver process.  ""What the Biden administration did was create a new, arguably easier, pathway through a state plan amendment,"" said Maria W. Steenland, a Brown University assistant professor of population studies. Under these plan amendments, facilitated by the American Rescue Plan, the federal government and states agree on how to administer the Medicaid program. Later, the 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which Biden signed into law in 2023, gave states the option to permanently extend postpartum coverage period to 12 months."	1	REAL	0.8229827
"Vice President Kamala Harris launched a national tour to promote the Biden administration’s commitment to abortion rights in Wisconsin, where abortion was effectively banned for 15 months under a 19th century law before a judge restored laws that allow abortions up to 20 weeks. In her speech in Big Bend, Harris attacked former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, for bragging about appointing three of the justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court precedent that enshrined abortion access nationally until the court overturned it in June 2022. ""This is, in fact, a health care crisis and there is nothing about this that is hypothetical,"" Harris told the crowd. ""Today in America, 1 in 3 women of reproductive age live in a state with an abortion ban."" With abortion as a top election issue, we wanted to check out the statistic. Harris’ claim was similar to a White House fact sheet that said ""more than 23 million women of reproductive age — one in three — live in one of the 18 states with an abortion ban currently in effect.""This includes 14 states where women cannot get abortions at any point in pregnancy, with limited exceptions. Two other states — Georgia and South Carolina — ban abortions past six weeks, when most women don’t yet know they are pregnant and haven’t had a chance to see a doctor. Two additional states, Nebraska and North Carolina, outlaw abortion after 12 weeks, around the earliest point in pregnancy when women can find out the fetus’ sex and if it carries certain chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome, Trisomy 13 and Edwards syndrome. States that ban abortion at six weeks or less can be reasonably considered to have ""bans"" on the books, experts told PolitiFact, as they leave residents with minimal access to an abortion. Others said laws could be categorized as a ban if they apply at conception or at any other point in pregnancy.Harris’ statistic is close even when counting just the populations of states with abortion bans at six weeks or less. How many U.S. women of reproductive age live in states with abortion bans Women who are considered to be of ""reproductive age"" in the United States are typically 15 to 44 years old. Some researchers and government organizations use a range of 15 to 49 years old to better reflect the increasing number of women having children later in life. There are about 65 million women in the U.S. ages 15 to 44, and about 75 million 15 to 49, 2022 Census data shows. Harris’ office pointed PolitiFact to news reports that found about 21 million to 25 million women of childbearing age lived in states that banned abortion or posed more restrictions on it than before Roe v. Wade was overturned. The Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, found in October 2022 that almost 22 million women ages 15 to 49 lived in states where abortion was ""unavailable or severely restricted,"" amounting to about 29% of the total U.S. population of women in that age range. Guttmacher’s media office told PolitiFact that the number is likely higher today, given the passage of more restrictions. The Associated Press found in June 2023 that more than 25 million women ages 15 to 44 live in states where the law makes abortions harder to get than they were before Roe was overturned. About 5.5 million more women, the report said, live in states where restrictions have been adopted but are on hold pending court challenges. ""Given the shifting landscape of abortion laws, many organizations have different definitions and categories for states’ abortion laws,"" said Laurie Sobel, women's health policy director at KFF. Today, approximately 21.5 million women ages 15 to 49 live in the 14 states that totally ban abortion, and in the two states with six-week bans in effect, she said. That comes out to about 29% of women of childbearing age, or about 1 in 3.4."	1	FAKE	0.34348208
